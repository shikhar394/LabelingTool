Voted down only last June by Miami-Dade County's Government Operations Committee, backers of this project must be thinking they finally have the votes to send the SR 836 (also known as the Dolphin Expressway) beyond the county's Urban Development Boundary and out along the edge of the Everglades. A vote and public hearing will take place this Wednesday morning beginning at 9 AM - see location map here: https://goo.gl/maps/225wNdYbqF42   The \"Government Center\" Metrorail Station will leave you inside the building.  Please try to attend and say NO to this unnecessary and harmful highway expansion.  This issue seems to have united environmentalists from throughout our region who know that new highways in still rapidly-growing South Florida have never alleviated traffic. Instead, expanded highways such as I-595 in Broward County have only facilitated more growth - along with expanded vehicle use.  And as we have pointed out again and again on this Facebook page - South Florida is already reeling under the weight of that development. Our freshwater aquifers are being pumped out to the point where - absent the rare veto from the governor - we almost had a state program to re-inject recycled sewage into our aquifers.  Coastal pollution from wastewater, plus road and agricultural runoff are killing our coastal ecosystems.  And the looming (but very real) threats from sea level rise and coastal flooding, saltwater intrusion into our aquifers, and acidification of our oceans (from excess CO2) round out the environmental nightmare we are creating.  For coastal wildlife which have to live in the runoff we are sending them - their nightmare has long begun.  And for the terrestrial wildlife displaced by our non-stop urban expansion, it is, unfortunately, already too late,    Expected environmental impacts from this particular road expansion include increased sprawl and traffic, endangerment of our underground water supply, paving over and degrading of wetlands and aquifer recharge areas, and threats to badly needed Everglades restoration projects.  More details here:  https://catalystmiami.org/hold-the-line-against-836-expansion/   Please try and join us this Wednesday morning at the county commission meeting.  There are better ways to solve South Florida's transportation crisis than building yet another major highway.  Most metropolitan areas the size of Miami-Dade County have invested heavily in viable mass-transit systems which allow safe, reliable, and rapid access to the entire region.  The Metrorail and Metromover rail lines in the eastern part of Miami-Dade already form a base for that system.  If the goal is removing congestion on area roads, getting drivers out of their cars (instead of onto an expanded highway system) is a much better way to go.",

        "Text": "HUMANISM MANIFESTO   The human development practice of the 20th century, which is the criterion of truth, revealed the utopian nature of communism theory, non-objectively pretended to a more productive method of material and spiritual benefits production which was meant to replace capitalism.   The founders of the communist theory, Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, whose theory was the basis of life for half of humanity in the 20th century, believed that capitalistic production method of material and spiritual benefits based on a private property at the expense of production and exploitation of man by man, consciously and necessarily, with the help of the state, proletarian dictatorship would be changed by a more productive communist method based on a public property at the expense of production, via the destruction of a private property in the course of the socialist revolution, which would eliminate the exploitation of man by man.  If, in their view, production methods of material and spiritual benefits, which had preceded the capitalist one, including it, were born in the depths of the historically obsolete preceding production methods, and blindly, by virtue of the objective laws of social development led to their change, so the communist production methods were meant to be established by a forcibly revolutionary way with the help of the state, proletarian dictatorship via the destruction of a private property at the expense of their production and its replacement by a public property.  The essence of the communist theory was set out by Marx in the \"Communist Manifesto\": \"the communists may express their theory via the provision: the destruction of a private property... \".  The communism theory and practice diametrically opposed themselves to the objective laws of the nature and human society development. These laws were discovered by the German philosopher G. Hegel in the 19th century: - unity and struggle (competition) of opposites as a source of nature and society development; - transition of quantitative changes into qualitative ones in nature and society; - the negation of the negation, i.e. the nature and society development on a virtuous circle.  The effect of these laws in nature and society by the followers of Marxism-Leninism, who were dogmatists and did not develop their theory, were incorrectly interpreted and put into practice.  The history of a human society development attests to the fact that social structures are based on the production methods of material and spiritual benefits, following each other in their development process via changing the ownership form on them. They were defined by the influence of the objective developmental laws of nature and society not blindly, but consciously objectively necessarily, i.e. directly proportional to the perception of these laws by humanity and its ability to use them in practice in order to replace its mental and physical labor in the material and spiritual benefits production. Nature, unlike humanity, develops blindly, by virtue of its laws.  So, the initial primitive-communal production method of material and spiritual benefits was founded on such means of production as a spear, a bow and primitive tools with stone tips for bush meat hunting and agriculture. These means belonged to the community. The product was received through the works of the community members using these means and was in the nature of a minimum required product to maintain the life of its members, in view of the low workforce productivity. There was no question of a surplus product that could be possessed and used by the most active and influential members.  A human discovery of copper, iron and a practical ability to use them for the production means of material and spiritual benefits led to the increase in labor productivity and the emergence of a surplus product, which was possessed and used by some of the most active and influential community members. Families, their private property at the expense of the production methods of material and spiritual benefits began to appear, and obtaining, as a result of its usage, material and spiritual benefits. This led to the formation of the state and law as the private property product, for its protection.  These objective laws in the human society evolution were reflected in the work of F.Engels \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\".  The primitive communal production method of material and spiritual benefits was replaced by a more productive slaveholding method, however, the necessary and surplus product was created by a human manual labor in its time. As a result of this, a division of labor, merchandise exchange and money circulation emerged and began to develop, as well as the struggle between peoples and states in the form of wars in order to seize their lands and property, hostages and slaves, which had already become a commodity.   As a consequence of the new nature laws discovery and evolutionary development on the basis of production means of material and spiritual benefits in agriculture, cattle breeding and craft, a slaveholding production method of material and spiritual benefits was replaced by a more productive feudal one, based on a private ownership of land holdings with the conversion of slaves into serfs workers.   In the medieval period, when a human being came to know new nature and society laws in mathematics, chemistry, physics and other sciences, as well as learned to obtain and use a thermal and electric energy out of nature substances, create cars and transport in the production process of material and spiritual benefits, which increasingly replaced mental and physical human energy in the production process of material and spiritual benefits. As a result, in the depths of the feudal production method an industry began to emerge and develop and on its material basis the capitalist production method of material and spiritual benefits, as well as commodity exchange and money circulation, based on a private ownership at the expense of material and spiritual benefits production, on the liberation of the serfs and their transformation into wage earners.  What did, in science and philosophy terms, the utopian theory and practice of communism include?  According to this theory, the public ownership production methods of material and spiritual benefits, formed the basis of the communist mode of production, which was to replace a capitalist one, based on a private ownership on them, with an egalitarian distribution of a produced by the workers product and monopoly ownership of the production means of material and spiritual benefits, forcibly removed the objective contradictions between the individual and material interests of workers. But these contradictions, opposites, the struggle of individuals with unequal abilities composed the objective internal original source of a social production development.  In other words, under the enforced equation of the congenitally unequal individuals by the state and monopoly ownership of production means of material and spiritual benefits, the objective preconditions for the action of discovered by G. Hegel laws of nature and society development, including its original source - the law of the unity and struggle of opposites.  Such artificial and utopian model of communist production method was deprived of objective internal sources for its development and was introduced by force, through the revolutionary way and existed with inadequate measures of administrative and criminal enforcement, and naturally, as history has shown, was doomed to destruction.  Mistaking the wish for the reality, his academic and political apologists, the \"true successors of the Marxism-Leninism classics \" in the 20th century assigned the label \"scientific\" to the communism theory, which had never happened before in other sciences - mathematics, physics, chemistry, philosophy... Agreeing with the communism founders that politics is the concentrated expression of the economy, i.e. the last was primary, and politics was secondary, they introduced a course of \"political economy\" to the society, although it was supposed to be about \"economic policy\".  Considering themselves as materialists, and capitalists as idealists, the communism advocates were idealists, not materialists, and their subordination to the objective laws of social development was recognized by capitalists, who on the contrary were materialists.  Communism, as a theory and historical practice, went down not only due to the theoretical and practical errors, communism died in a naturally historical way. So there is no need to look for guilty ones. That was not so much the fault of its followers, entire nations, generations and their states, as their misfortune. Our grandfathers, fathers, and partly we sacrificed our lives for this; therefore, there is no need to desecrate their historical errors, which were not deprived of historical achievements. Humans are prone to errors, as errors, objectively, are one of understanding way of nature and society laws and their use in practice.  Communist revolutions in the 20th century, set off by the socialist revolution of 1917 in Russia, were utopian, based on the utopian doctrine of communism. The revolutions that accompanied the historical changes of the production methods of material and spiritual benefits, objectively, deliberately necessarily, peacefully or forcibly led to the state power of the owners of their production means. The question naturally arises, in what direction humanity is moving in now?  Having addressed Marx, we see that he divides history into three eras. The first era, including the capitalist one and all preceding production methods, at which the development has the character of a natural historical process, the objective laws of which are not subject to people, Marx calls this the realm of natural necessity. This era, over which the relations of a private property as the blind alienated power dominate, the true realm of freedom opposed to them - the era of humanism.  However, these two eras, two kingdoms, according to Marx, have to be mediated by another intermediate realm, a realm of perceived need - the era of communism.  In K. Marx's opinion \"in communism era, a human productive activity is necessary, but increasingly subservient to their will, when freedom is still in the limits of necessity, but the necessity itself is not natural, but perceived, and in this sense passes into freedom. Freedom in that respect can only consist in the fact that the associated manufacturers rationally regulate their metabolism with nature and evolutionarily put it under a total control, instead of dominating them as a blind force. However, this still remains the realm of necessity. Beyond it, the human forces development begins, which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can flourish only on this realm of necessity as on its basis\".  The second half of the 20th century demonstrated in practice the fallacy of this provision, as well as the fallacy of the communism theory. The historical transition from capitalism as a production method of material and spiritual benefits to humanism, as a new production method, which will replace it, will take place not in the utopian communism epoch, but via objectively necessarily evolutionary way in the depth of capitalism, on the basis of discoveries of new nature and society laws and the ability to use them in practice.   In the era of humanism, production means of material and spiritual benefits, created by the human mind and labor, based on the proportionally high enough for this perception level of nature and society laws, by virtue of objective developmental laws of nature and society, used by humanity, will completely replace mental and physical human energy in the production process of material and spiritual benefits. The struggle between people in the course of production process of material and spiritual benefits, private property on them as the primary sources of a social production self-development, market relations, based on the value of the goods will pass out, rather disappear. The state and law, protecting private property on them, will disappear, and they will be replaced by a public sector and moral-ethical rules.  If, prior to the humanism establishment, the basic contradiction underlying the humanity existence and development, was its struggle with the Earth nature to ensure the conditions for its life by its rational, natural metabolism with nature, then in the era of humanism the basic contradiction defining the humanity life and progress, will be its struggle with the infinite in time and space Universe through realizing its laws and using them for this.  In our days a human being is relatively helpless in time and space at the scale of the Universe as he was thousands of years in the past before the Earth nature. A human being can live on the Earth and in the Universe physically and spiritually so long as he deeply perceives the laws of the Earth and Universe and will learn to use them in his everyday life. However, due to the law of relativity, discovered by A. Einstein, and other laws of the Earth and Universe, his life duration in time and space, will be as relatively short as it is nowadays.  The development of humanity, which in the 20th century was drained with 2 world wars, which claimed the lives of tens of millions of people, as well as wasted hundreds of trillions of dollars for the arms race during the 3rd \"cold\" world war between capitalism and utopian communism objectively sorely fell astern of its current needs due to an insufficient knowledge level of nature and society laws and on this basis creation of the adequate production means of material and spiritual benefits which led to the fact that the conditions of its existence shifted from its rational natural exchange with nature substances to their destruction.   This resulted in a global warming, hundreds of millions of people are starving, and tens of millions are dying of hunger. Such devastating phenomena on a global scale as an armament race, burning trillions of dollars in its firebox, international terrorism, trade and shooting wars between states, ethnic and religious armed conflicts, generating huge waves of migration, drug addiction, and growth of life-threatening diseases follow the life of the humanity.  In our days the global economy, being in the hands of transnational corporations, is experiencing a deep crisis due to abuse of the natural resources rent, de-industrialization in pursuit of super profits in the countries with cheap labor, the gap between labor and capital and between industrial and financial capitals.  Humanity in the form of its individuals, nations and their states develops by virtue of objective laws of nature and society consciously objectively necessarily, directly proportionally to the perception of these laws and its ability to use them in practice. Therefore, competitive struggle, rivalry between them is an objective category of their existence, the source of their development.  In the 21st century, the humanity must join its forces to meet its material needs in energy, through the way of laws perception and thermonuclear fusion mastering, the needs in food products through the way of laws perception and biological synthesis mastering and other reasonably objective requirements, on the basis of perception and mastering of new laws and their use in other areas (semblance of nature) which will lead to the complete replacement of its mental and physical energy, on production means of material and spiritual benefits created by the humanity.  The first sprouts, swallows of a new production method of material and spiritual benefits based on the principles of humanism at the junction of 20th-21st centuries of became the perception and use of the laws in such nature and society areas as the digital electronic computerization, which will be replaced by the digital quantum computerization of the human productive activity and robotization of the latter, which aimed at the replacement of mental and physical human energy in the production process of material and spiritual benefits.  Civic organizations of a human society and moral and ethical rules will replace the state and law evolutionary, consciously, objectively necessarily. In the era of humanism purely human relations between people will be established instead of commodity-money ones, the ideals of Truth, Benefit and Beauty will spring to life.

While I take exception to the implication that I am \"pretending\" to be of Native American ancestry because my skin and hair aren't as dark as one would expect, I do also understand that there are many in the Indigenous community who have suffered much more than I could ever imagine.  Last night in New Mexico, our friend Deb Haaland, member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, won the Democratic primary for U. S. Congressional District 1. Deb is an amazing Native woman, and has fought long and hard for this victory. She is a shining example of a politician who will advocate for the working class, for women, and for the Native community.   I am excited to join Deb and several more Native women candidates for U.S. Congress this year, as we become the first Native American women to ever serve in the U.S. House of Representatives!  Congratulations Deb Haaland for Congress! And thank you for paving the way for the rest of us!",

Incredibly, Mr. Trump appears to accept at face value Mr. Putin's continual denial that Russia had any involvement in tampering with the 2016 election, despite mounting evidence to the contrary brought forth by his own U.S. intelligence agencies.  An attack on our elections-- the core component of our democratic process--is an attack on the bedrock of our country, and should be responded to in a more appropriate manner. It is disturbing that this summit even took place today-- It should have been cancelled, or at the very least postponed until the facts on this case are fully brought to bear.",

If given the opportunity, I would prioritize this issue, to help provide the assistance to our brothers and sisters who have fallen on hard times.    Part of my plan includes modernizing Public Law 20-159 (which has existed since the early 90's) to create a One Stop transitional center where those economically disadvantaged can attain the opportunities to secure social programs (housing, SNAP, WIC, etc), as well as access labor and educational opportunities that exist.    This transitional center would essentially house various entity representatives under the purview of DPHSS, to enhance efficiency and simplicity.  We aren't creating a new department or positions, and will essentially be updating an existing law and assuring it's implementation .    In terms of funding to help implement and supplement this transitional center and PL 20-159, our team has identified a source, and will be placing this in a draft bill format for release soon.   In fact, we are open to any sitting senator willing to consider this idea TODAY, as this is not about who gets the credit, but rather it's about assuring that our people are taken care of sooner than later.    The reality is that while this plan is not the golden egg to completely solve this problem, it essentially involves baby steps to help a number of families in need.  Many aren't asking for just hands outs, rather they are seeking the opportunity to reinvigorate back into the community.    Helping families transition towards financial independence is another step towards revitalizing our community.  When it comes to the government helping those who are gravely in need, our community Expects More from elected officials.  The time to deliver was yesterday.",

The Gig Harbor Sustainable Coalition is working with organizations and businesses to ban plastic straws and find replacements for single use plastic. it Is up to all of us to be good stewards of our beaches, Water and Wildlife. Once an ordinance is signed it will take about 6 - 18 months before it goes into effect. We will be suggesting successful ordinances already working in other Washington cities.    DOES THE CITY HAVE TIME TO BAN PLASTIC STRAWS?    During council comments, Councilwoman Woock said she is concerned with the state of pollution and use of plastic in the city and requested the city initiate work on an ordinance that would ban plastic straws, initiate a reusable-bag policy and replacement policy for single-use plastic in Gig Harbor. Woock requested the ordinance be ready by the first council meeting in October and requested a council work session be schedule for September 12.  \"This is of great environmental importance,\" Woock said.  Kuhn said he did not believe the council or city staff had time to add another item to their plates although he supported the idea of a ban. City staff commended Woock on previous research she has done into similar bans in nearby cities, citing Tacoma and Seattle, but said research and planning on how to enforce the ban, when to schedule a public meeting and the time frame to implement the plan would take more time and effort from city staff.  Every member of the council was in favor of the idea, despite the schedule constraints, except for Councilman Michael Perrow, who said the ban sounded like a \"one-off enforcement\" issue.  The idea of a ban on single-use plastic will be brought to the Finance and Safety Committee and will possibly be brought to the council in the form of an ordinance this fall.",

There is no full plan in the actual schools in my area yet, but I'm sure officials are working on one.  I've noticed our society waits until something bad happens; at that point it's too late.  Teachers and students will panic, making them an easy target. No worries though, I'm going to the district and SC Law enforcement division \"eventually\" to find out what they are actually doing/ have done.  I will give them free advice because it's just what needs to be done since I will probably not be included on any planning \"since I'm nobody to them and dont have their criminal justice degree\".  Schools usually have to wait on politics, laws, and sometimes parents to get certain things approved/funded \"talking to students can be done now\". So Im here to help them be more proactive and give them a different view to believe in. I can provide a \"system or series\" of actions that cover the full aspect of keeping our children safe.  Just having a cop or resource officer isn't the full answer, although it is a great start. We have resource officers here in SC.  Thats not enough when it is the students mind that you need to reach an monitor closely also.    In the mean time, first contact will be made via email to the principles/ vice principle a few local schools close to my residence. Once Im in a school \"probably after they do a background check\" , Im going to talk to students starting with Saturday school, ROTC, and maybe some detentions, and pep-rallys. While doing this, I will also keep track of at risk students see if this  \"school to prison pipeline\" is a thing since I left highschool. I do want to start with a highschool because their minds are most fragile in this case.  With puberty, mental disorders, teen love, and unchecked mental trauma; these young minds can snap at any time. So we have to make this some what of a movement, so we can possibly catch  \"at risk minds\" before they snap.  \"I have my own process for this\".  When I mentioned a multi-step plan. I'm saying there are evolutions to this and it starts with building the trust and support of the staff and students.  If we want to help prevent school violence, we start with the minds that will create it. 2nd part of the plan will be assigning everyone roles/ scenario training.  My active duty/ veteran friends can tell you how effective scenario training, but it will simply be repetition of the roles, duties, and actions that should take place in the event of a school shooting .  That's all I can say for now, but I will give an update on progress after I hear from a school.  Use this as your guide if needed.  The future of this moment will employ veterans nationwide because so many Marines/ veterans I know personally, that are capable of protecting schools \"armed\" and/or  capable of providing some form of emergency planning.  I've talked to a few staff members in  local schools and random teachers I meet in my area, and they let me know there is no plans.  Some even told mr they thought of their own \"safe space\" for their students. You may not see much happening on here because I'm finding out this is also the networking/ building contacts phase/ finding the best rought to take.  Once I get in a school this page will blossom with more post to show you some progress.  UPDATE:  I did contact one highschool about a month before school ended here.  I recieved no reply email, so next yr I will email more of the staff, just so they can't ignore it. But Im hoping \"my push\" puts pressure on the district to have a plan ready to go.  I want them to understand, there's way more to be done and having someone with a gun is great but not even close to the final answer.  #StandByAmerica  #AndThisIsHowIUniteUS  Lafayette \"US\" 2020 ",

This means that the city, county, or state will have to foot the bill for the expenses that exceed projected revenues.   The debate over who should pay for this has been going on for some time now. With city residents also paying county taxes, my belief is that the county should have to cover the difference (or reduce expenses.) I suspect others may argue differently.   Why should city residents have to cover two-thirds of the cost for E-911?",

Most members of Congress have abdicated their powers and obligation, of functioning as a coequal branch of the government.  Many congressional members are lax because they feel they do not need to do much, in order to be re-elected. They are incumbents, that have chosen to function at a semi comatose state. These representatives are no longer motivated, to deliver positive results to their constituents.  Consequently, congressional otiosity levels have risen to an all-time high. We basically have a number of career politicians that have been dormant for too long, including the present representative for CA's 6th district.   The voices and concerns of Sacramento and some Yolo county citizens, have not really been heard in a long time. A national roll call is taking place, ladies and gentlemen.  ..And the citizens of CA's 6th district are being marked absent.  We are absent in this representative democracy, not because we do not have a representative in Congress - but because we have a representative that cannot show up with fervor, and be counted.  A representative that has failed to step up, and declare through words or actions..that, we the people of CA's 6th district are PRESENT and open for business!  I can become that much-needed, inspired and dependable congressman for this district.  A congressman that cares about the needs of the constituents, and not his re election. A congressman that will actually read a bill thoroughly, before voting on it. A congressman that is completely untethered to lobbyists or special interests. The people's congressman.  Colleagues have always described me as a team player. I possess the skills set required, to navigate through the complexities and bureaucracy in congress, to obtain outstanding results in a timely manner.  I can also work synergistically with congressmen and women from other political parties, to accomplish notable feats for the nation. For me, it has always been..country first, before partisan politics.  Folks, we need change. We need new energy. We need unconventional fighters because these are unconventional times. We need bold, fresh ideas from thoughtful, stoic leaders with the requisite knowledge and experience for the job.  CA's 6th district cannot be forced to retire, because of the inactivity of the people that are supposed to represent it.  We reject that notion.  If elected, I will work tirelessly to implement effective solutions, to the enduring problems of this district and the country in general.  ..And I stand ready to win the good fight for every American - especially the silent, hardworking men and women of this country. The CA 6th congressional district has to roar back to life. It needs to reconfigure, in order to thrive in 2019 and beyond.  Write in your vote for me, in the primary elections on June 5th, 2018.

        "Text": "We lost one. Are our protections going down the drain?   Quoted in Business Insurance Magazine re the loss of a trans case, EEOC v. Rent-A-Center, in Illinois federal court:   \"There were pretty significant differences in testimony about why (Ms. Kerr) was terminated,\" said Jillian Weiss, a New York-based solo attorney, who represents LGBT people.   \"The jury resolved the credibility question in favor of the employer,\" she said. \"It's a signal that transgender people now get to be treated like any other employee\" and \"juries have a right to believe them or not, and I think that's as fair a result as can be hoped for.\"   I said this in the context of the  court ruling in this case, prior to trial. The court held that transgender people are protected from sex discrimination. It also ruled there was enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find sex discrimination.   AN EQUAL CHANCE, BUT AT AN UNEQUAL TARGET  Thus, courts, including in the Heartland, understand we're protected under the law. It also means we have an equal chance with everyone else to have our day in court. But for employees, that day is a little bit shorter. The target is a bit farther away.    Statistics show that only about 30% of job discrimination plaintiffs going to trial in federal court win a verdict, as opposed to 45% of plaintiff wins in federal cases generally. That's a huge differential. The deck is stacked against job discrimination plaintiffs across the board, not just LGBTQ employees. Careful and thoughtful curation of cases is important, and even so, it's probably better to settle if you can. Even after a verdict is won, there are appeals, and large verdicts are often pared down a lot. A bad settlement is better than a good judgment.   I don't think LGBTQ job protections are going down the drain. However, I do think we need to strengthen our job discrimination laws generally.   There's speculation in the article that the jury was infected with anti-trans bias. Given the poisonous climate in our country, it's certainly plausible. But I haven't seen any evidence of it in this case yet.     WE STILL HAVE LEGAL PROTECTIONS; LET'S KEEP FIGHTING  I also noted this hopeful point in the article: \"There's no indication that I've ever seen that the EEOC is pulling back from its position regarding protection to transgender people from discrimination,\" said Ms. Weiss.   In fact, I just received word of a victory at the EEOC in one of my cases against a major aerospace defense contractor. Thankfully, the EEOC is an independent commission that doesn't answer directly to the Administration.   While there are many troubling developments in law and politics under the current Administration, we've still got the federal courts. There are about 145 federal judicial vacancies, 19 in the appeals court and 125 in the district court. The Administration has seated 14 appeals court judges and 14 district court judges as of May 2018. Lambda Legal issued a report in December 2017 indicating that it classified about one-third as anti-LGBT. At this rate, it will take them many years to stack the deck against us. At some point, we may need to switch to state courts. Not yet.   The new nominee for EEOC General Counsel, Sharon Fast Gustafson, is troublesome, however. The Leadership Conference on Human and Civil Rights issued a letter stating concerns about her evasive answers on LGBTQ rights.  I'll keep on fighting, and I hope you will too.",

I don't know about you, but the last straw came when discussion began about teachers carrying guns for protection at school.  This stress continued as I was working 2 jobs only to find myself still with over $25,000 of credit card debt.   70-80 hour weeks just trying to get by and worrying whether an accident would occur to keep me from coming home to my family.   Not only would I wake up every day not happy to go into work, but I would constantly think about the debt I had looming on my shoulders.  Do you have these feelings as well?  A change finally happened for me!  I want the same for you!  I sat down and really thought about my life. I wrote down what would be my perfect day, week, or year without the fears and stress I know each of us are having.  I challenge you to do the same.  I listed the top 10 things that would make me happy and free from the stress that was holding me down and the reality that was keeping me there.  I listed that I was debt free, of course.  But, I wanted to continue to do something I was passionate about, which was to help people become a better version of themselves through a business that was my own without the risk to my personal safety.   Isn't helping others why we all do what we do?  It was at that time that I was introduced to my mentor. He helped me see that I could be in charge of my own reality.  I want to share this experience with you too.  Soon after meeting my mentor, I was introduced to two of the most energetic and supporting individuals that are helping me change my life personally and professionally.  Both quit their jobs and are traveling the world to experience life while helping others become happier and healthier.  Best part is that they don't have fear in this work.   All of this freedom within just a few months of starting a little internet business on the side.  All because of a hidden secret that they call the '3-Step Laptop Freedom Formula'.  After being introduced to the '3-Step Laptop Freedom Formula', I've become my own boss.  I was in charge of my own reality and did not have any fear of losing precious memories with my family.   The best part, I'm not doing this alone.  I am waking up with a smile on my face because I'm part of something bigger than myself.  Don't you want this as well?  Just like my mentor and new friends, I want to share this life changing experience with you as well.  As you might know, I had 1,000 questions and alarmingly HIGH levels of skepticism.   This can't be real at all. That's what I kept asking myself and I know you are too.   This is very real and can change your life as well.  I want it for you!  My mentor has put together a quick micro-training with the help of our two other mentors, Landon and Stapes, to take a peek behind the curtain on how they are making a full time income as internet marketers.  This helped set aside my skepticism, as I know it will for you.   This training is 100% free and you can register here, but it won't last forever.  http://www.derekcroad.com/  IMPORTANT: This training isn't designed to sit back, watch, and do nothing. It will be different than anything you've seen before because we actually walk you through actionable strategies that are currently working for us, right this very minute.  As I said, I was very skeptical when my mentor approached me in regards to this training.  Trust me, I get it.   However, I was ready for a true change, to be safe in my own business.  I took a risk to make a change and to just hear them out.  The funny thing is I had zero experience online and this stuff is actually working.    Let's do this together and make a real, positive impact on people's lives.  Just like we wanted to do when we became teachers but now without the fear for our own safety.   Go here to grab your free spot now. There is limited seating and your seat in this master class could disappear any day.  http://www.derekcroad.com/  See how our mentors quit their jobs and travel the world using the simple '3-Step Laptop Freedom Formula'.

        "Text": "Moving the Sheriff's office forward is key in my campaign.  What follows are some of my key points.  As you read them I would like you to keep in mind there are some great people that work for the Yakima County Sheriff's office and they deserve the best in leadership.  A leader that understands that people make mistakes and knows how to move on from those mistakes.  It is what is learned from those mistakes and how management deals with them going forward that shows true leadership.  Often people look to blame the person directly involved, when it is quite possible there was something lacking in their training, process (procedure), or their management direction.  I bring that type of leadership.  I bring that type of understanding. The people of Yakima County deserve the best service from the Sheriff's office and its leadership.  With that comes a sense of responsibility and accountability to the people we serve.  It should be the leadership's position to always keep the public informed of what is going on in the department.  Did you know that the Yakima County Sheriff's Office was an accredited agency with the Washington Association of Sheriff's and Police Chief's (WASPC)?  Did you notice I said was?  That is because it no longer is.  When you call and ask WASPC about this they will tell you that Yakima County Sheriff's office is not currently accredited.  They will also tell you they applied for reaccreditation and prior to the assessment re-contacted WASPC and said they were not going to complete the reaccreditation process.  I was told that I would have to ask the agency whey they did not complete the process. I will try to obtain the information on why they are no longer accredited. I think it is important we all know why the Sheriff's office is no longer a state accredited agency, don't you?  Under my leadership, not only would you know we were seeking reaccreditation, but you would know why it didn't happen or was delayed.  Being totally honest with you though, if the agency had worked hard enough to become accredited, there would be nothing that would keep us from maintaining our accreditation.  Please look over my three main points and keep in mind I bring a leadership style that encompasses all areas of leadership, rather than the thought that I am the next guy up so it falls on me to be the bearer.  I have prepared myself in all areas; experience, education, and training. I can think outside of the box to incorporate different avenues to provide a better service to the valley we all call home.   Public Safety Public Safety in Yakima County is the highest priority of the Sheriff's department. In 2009 when I left the department there were 72 commissioned Deputies.  Currently there are 61 commissioned deputies. Increased Deputies means more patrols and more Deputies available. As Sheriff it will be my primary focus to increase the number of Deputies and improve the safety for all who live in Yakima County.  Interagency Cooperation Working side by side with other law enforcement agencies in the county is imperative.  We not only need to work together we need to train together.  Continuing to work with and build relationships with other law enforcement agencies, our schools, and our citizens through neighborhood watches is necessary for the safety of the people of Yakima County.  As Sheriff I will continue to improve and build on these collaborative relationships.  I look forward to adding SRO's to the rural school districts in the county as well. In order to fight crime within the Yakama Nation it is important to build a relationship with the Yakama Nation government and its people.  People living within the boundaries of the Yakama Nation should be able to call for assistance without the first question they are asked being \"are you enrolled\".  I envision the Sheriff's office and the Yakama Nation people continuing to grow their relationship so that we can combat crime together within the Nation.  A relationship that ensures all people living within its boundaries live in safety knowing that no matter who they call for help, help will come.  Transparency and Accountability As Sheriff I will be open and accountable to the people of Yakima County. My administration will be transparent in what we do and look to improve all aspects of the service we provide to the people of Yakima County. Continuously working toward being the best law enforcement agency everyone expects to represent Yakima County.",
