        "Text": "How important is good Healthcare?  It was in March of 2012 that my wife, an athlete & avid runner, first began to exhibit mild symptoms of light headedness during exercise. Eventually, after multiple unproductive trips to her doctor, she had an episode of fainting during a half marathon. For more than a year we fought with a greedy insurance company that refused to approve what they deemed as \"unnecessary\" additional diagnostic testing her physician had repeatedly ordered.  Sharon suddenly passed away in June of 2013, just 3 days before she was scheduled to finally to receive the testing her insurance company had been denying. Sadly, she was determined to have succumbed to a treatable heart arrhythmia. Timely testing would likely have saved my wife's life. The insanity of America's healthcare system cost my three sons their mother and I lost my wife one month short of our twentieth wedding anniversary.  Painful experience has taught me that healthcare isn't a Republican or Democrat issue, it's a life and death matter for ALL Americans.  I am running for Congress because fixing our broken healthcare system and finding real solutions that puts patients first isn't just idle talk. I will act to make sure no American ever has their health or life put behind corporate profits again.  It is my promise that if elected, it will be my solemn mission to make health care available and affordable to all American's.  My name is Ted Howze and I'm the local veterinarian running for congress. I humbly ask for your vote on June 5th.  More info at: www.tedhowze.com",

According to the agency, most seniors who ride SEPTA have already switched to the SEPTA Key Senior Photo Identification cards.   Starting Sept. 1, seniors will need the SEPTA Key Senior Photo ID Card to receive free rides on transit and discounted Regional Rail fares ($1 for travel in Pennsylvania). Valid Pennsylvania driver's licenses and non-driver IDs with a magnetic stripe on the back can still be swiped at turnstiles and fare boxes; new licenses issued by PennDOT on or after July 2017 do not have magnetic strips and cannot be used.   Seniors who sign up by Aug. 1 will have their SEPTA Key Senior Photo ID card mailed to them no later than Sept. 1.   To receive a SEPTA Key Senior Photo ID Card, applicants must fill out an application and show one of the following forms of identification:   * Pennsylvania Driver/Non-Driver ID.  * Birth certificate or baptismal certificate.  * Yellow PACE Card (Pharmaceutical assistance Contract for the Elderly).  * Statement of Age Verification from the U.S. Social Security Administration.  * Armed forces discharge/separation papers.  * Resident alien card or passport/naturalization papers.

In the last year, we have seen both the Governor and the Speaker of the House removed from office because of corruption.  I believe we need a serious housecleaning in Montgomery. I believe elected officials should be held to a high standard.  I am a political outsider. I have never run for public office before, and I'm not a member of the \"good-ole-boys\" club. About 97% of the money I have raised has come from LOCAL individuals and businesses (and myself), so I'm not beholden to Montgomery Special Interests.   I have done my part to support ethics and fight against corruption as a member of the Republican Steering Committee. I supported a resolution calling on Governor Bentley to resign, and supported a code of ethics for the Steering Committee itself.   The good news is, the tough ethics laws the Republicans passed in 2010 are working.  In fact, they are working so well that the laws are holding officials in the Republican Party accountable.  Ethics is not a partisan issue.  We all agree that it is imperative that we be able to trust our elected officials.   I do not support weakening the ethics laws. (I would work to revise the text of the laws for clarity's sake.)  Alabama needs to make greater strides to clean up corruption in Montgomery.  This can only be accomplished by sending fresh people to the Legislature...people who are concerned about representing the local citizens...not padding their pockets or selling out to Special Interest groups so they can get money for their re-election campaign.   I would appreciate your vote in the June 5th Republican Primary!",
