        "Text": "MAY 14, 2018 - COUNCIL PASSED THE BUDGET 6-1  Only Councilor Stone voted no.  The budget reduces the beginning cash balance at the end of next year by $463,000, or 24%. Some cuts were made for materials/services, but personnel costs were up $544,000.  If overspending $463K was due to an anomaly, for instance replacing all of the computers in the city, it would be less concerning. But the costs are personnel. And personnel costs tend not to go away, but escalate with cost of living adjustments, step increases, health insurance costs, and the ever menacing villain, PERS.  In order to address the pre-vote complaining of citizens regarding the budget, Councilor Luzier, the budget chair, asked that a statement be read from the auditors. In it they mentioned that the cash balance had almost doubled from 2013-17 showing improved financial capacity. This is true. Previous to that, I understand that the city borrowed money from the loan proceeds to build the water plant to pay the bills from July 1 until November, when the property taxes started coming in.  It was Councilor Tim Bradley who championed putting an end to this practice, and a conservative council backed him up, insisting that the beginning fiscal year cash balance needed to be increased to a healthy level.  The auditors also stated that at the end of April 2018 (right after the final property tax revenue has come in), the cash balance was $2.2 million. But is that relevant to the discussion? It matters what the cash balance is in October when the city finances have been under the strain of not having significant revenue for 6 months. But more significantly, it matters what the cash balance will be at the end of the NEXT fiscal year after a year of spending more than the city is receiving!  The budget process in the past several years has become more than disappointing. Three to four nights of training were given to budget committee members and council members from the finance director every other year or so. Government budgeting is unlike normal business budgeting. To make intelligent decisions regarding a government budget, one must understand those differences. That training has not been done in years.  The budget committee of better days took 4 or 5 evenings to go through the budget line by line, asking questions and debating financial planning. Those days are gone. In the last three budget cycles, Councilor Luzier has pushed through the budget in less than two hours. \"Are there any questions?\" and \"Do I hear a motion?\" are often said in the same breath. Anyone who thinks there is a modicum amount of public input and/or consideration into the city budget process is mistaken.  The bottom line is, in my opinion, spending more than the city is receiving is going in the wrong direction. If the city is reducing its cash balance by 24% each year, how many years before there is no cash balance?",

You can listen live on KBOO 90.7 fm,  or stream the show at www.kboo.fm or listen to a podcast of this program anytime at:   http://www.kboo.fm/program/voices-animals    Dab Steadman talks with Steven Wise, founder & driving force behind the Non-human Rights Project, about his lifelong battle to break down the legal wall separating human animals from  non-human ones in the eyes of the court.  During this program, Professor Wise will discuss his efforts to attain 'legal personhood' for some non-human animals.  Professor Wise is a legal scholar and practicing attorney who for the past 30 years has specialized in animal protection issues. He has taught courses in animal law at several schools, including Harvard, Stanford and Lewis & Clark College.   Mr. Wise has also authored 4 important books, has been the subject of a documentary film (\"Unlocking the Cage\"), and attends animal rights conferences all over the world...including the recent  \"Free the Elephants International Conference & Film Fest\" in Portland, OR (April 27-29th, 2018).   The Yale Law Journal has called him \"one of the pistons of the Animal Rights movement\". In this interview, Professor Wise shares why he felt compelled to start the \"Non-human Rights Project\",  why attaining \"personhood status\" for some animals is so significant,  and how he's framed his legal arguments in the courts.  He sums up his thoughts by saying that \"Animals shouldn't be treated like animals\"!

The campaigning group Avaaz, with the technical support of the Elephant Action League, bought 109 items of ivory and had them tested (at Oxford University to determine their age) using radiocarbon dating. Nearly one-fifth of the objects were found to contain ivory from animals killed since 1990.  Three-quarters of the items were dated to after 1947. The sale of ivory made after that date is subject to restrictions, and to be sold legally requires official documentation.  Avaaz said the findings, which echo other research that has found illegal ivory objects on sale in the UK and elsewhere, showed that Europe should do more to investigate and control the ivory trade.  Bert Wander, campaign director at Avaaz, said: \"This proves beyond doubt that illegal ivory is being sold across Europe. It must spark the end of this bloody trade. Every day the sale of these trinkets continues is a day closer to wiping out majestic elephants forever.\"  https://s3.amazonaws.com/avaazimages.avaaz.org/AVAAZ_EUROPES_DEADLY_IVORY_TRADE.pdf",

Even in Idaho, gun-ban advocates are on the march and out-of-state groups are pushing their gun-ban agenda here.  Lt. Col. Oliver North, the incoming President of the National Rifle Association, is speaking in Pocatello on June 29 as part of the Idaho Republican State Convention. He will support our candidates with strong NRA records, and stress the importance of defending and protecting our Constitutional Right to Keep and Bear Arms.  Whether you're a gun owner yourself or simply someone who cares deeply about our Second Amendment rights, you'll want to join us for our Gala Dinner on Friday, June 29 at 7 p.m., in Holt Arena on the Idaho State University campus. The Pre-Dinner Reception starts at 6:30 p.m.  Gala Dinner tickets are $50 each. Click on the link to buy tickets from Idaho State University.  Retired Lt. Col. North is a combat-decorated Marine, the recipient of the Silver Star, the Bronze Star for valor, and two Purple Hearts for wounds in action. From 1983 to 1986 he served as the U.S. government's counter-terrorism coordinator on the National Security Council staff. He has written numerous books on the American Military, including the \"American Heroes\" series and \"A Greater Freedom.\" He has served on the NRA Board of Directors since 1998 and is the founder of Freedom Alliance, a foundation providing college scholarships to the sons and daughters of U.S. military personnel killed in the line of duty.",

As always feel free to send me a message to let me know where you think I got it right and what changes you would make. Thanks, Nathan.  Michigan K-12 Education:  To improve the quality of education in Michigan we must empower the parents and hold schools accountable for their results. I believe a child's location should not determine the quality of education you receive and I support the following actions to move education forward in Michigan:  1.) Choice: Establish complete school choice. Including public schools, charter schools, home schooling, online education, education savings accounts (ESA's). As long as an acceptable curriculum can be verified the parents should be allowed and encouraged to take the reins in their child's education.  2) Funding: Make all Proposal A funds a uniform foundation grant. 100% of the funds should be available for all students to cover their cost of education at their school of choice- along with additional targeted funding for special needs.  3.) Accountability:  I believe requirements for quality and transparency should be applied uniformly to all public schools. We can improve teacher quality through an evaluation system that is concerned with student outcomes. I support rewarding high-performing teachers and requiring ineffective teachers to either improve their process and results or leave the profession. Educators that we trust with our youth whether public or private schooling must be held accountable for their performance.",

We have a human trafficking problem and a street known as Rape Alley that if we ignore this it  will hurt our tourism Industry. By failing to address public safety implications we are only having half the conversation.   I liked the sports center and spoke with local residents who would be most impacted and business owners who also favored the center. My concern is that the price escalated so quickly that it gives me pause. I like the concept but I do think a longer conversation needs to be had about the escalation in price.

Konkin III, Gary Chartier, Kevin Carson, and others, on how these thinkers have proposed taking centrist or moderate approaches towards solving economic problems which have divided conservative-leaning Libertarians from the radical Left.   The focus will be on issues related to landed property, markets, organized labor, and political freedom & social contract theory. I will also touch on the similarities and differences which Libertarians have with Greens, socialists, and anarchists, and outline potential political strategies which their agreements suggest may be a practical way to achieve multi-partisan political change.\"  Information: http://www.collegeofcomplexes.org/   College of Complexes The Playground for People Who Think - a weekly free speech forum on social issues and current events since 1951 Every Saturday at 6:00 PM Dappers East Restaurant 2901 W.

Wear Orange is a nationwide event focused on awareness of the issue of gun violence. There is a large Northern Virginia-wide Rally in Alexandria on Saturday, June 2. GAG is going to bring our special sauce to this community event in the form of 18 Human Beings, each representing a single gun victim killed within the city over the past several years. Also, Chris Cox, NRA's chief lobbyist happens to live a few blocks away. Wouldn't it be terrible if they were all to walk past his house?   WHERE YOU COME IN We need bodies. 18 of them, plus 5 or so more to help manage the performance. Whether you've done an action with us before doesn't matter. It is easy, and fun, and also sad, but by doing it you really bring your energy into the movement in a way that is directly meaningful to those who view it. This stuff matters. We need you.   WHAT YOU CAN DO Fill out the form below! Sign up to participate. Send it to your friends. Let's make this big. GAG will provide further instructions once you sign up but it's in just a couple weeks so this is urgent. Let's do this! We will win this fight if we all join in!",

You lose all your free time, including time with your family. You spend evenings poring over election data and voter lists and trying to meet and talk to as many voters as possible. You research every issue that could come up in your next interview or forum. You track and report on every penny of your contributions and expenses. You plan events and fundraisers. You write copy for literature, and design your information cards, buttons and t-shirts. You create and maintain your web presence and your social media platforms. (Real talk: Not every candidate does this all themselves. Just the ones who can't afford to hire someone to do it for them, haha.)  I am not asking for sympathy here-- I am simply asking for your VOTE. The thing that keeps me going, and makes it all worth it to me, is knowing that, once elected, I will be able to help the people of Oklahoma who have consistently been ignored or hurt by our current administration.  Teachers, women, the poor & working class, the LGBTQ+ community, people of color-- ALL these groups have been victims of the oppression of their rights and opportunities for FAR too long.

I am so glad when I get a different shift and don't have to pick up on this road\".  Why, in such a well-off county, are our roads in such horrible shape?! Why are we putting lives and property at risk?? When people ask me why I agreed to run, I always say \"it's about the roads---there is no excuse for how neglected our area is for road care.\" I think the county ignores our corner because we aren't the wealthy I-75 corridor.

We had three kids in college at the same time, so I know the \u001ffinancial burden all too well. I'm running to help make college and vocational training affordable again by bringing back the Michigan Promise Scholarship, bigger and better, so every child is able to pursue their dreams.  In 2006, Gov. Granholm created the Michigan Promise Scholarship, which gave students up to $4,000 toward their college education. Before the Michigan Promise Scholarship was eliminated, it was just a tiny fraction of the state's budget.  Since then, Gov. Snyder and legislative Republicans have given out billions in corporate welfare. If we use just a third of this, we can provide every high school graduate in Michigan with up to $30,000 toward technical training or a college degree.  I promise to work tirelessly to make college affordable again by bringing back the Michigan Promise Scholarship, bigger and better, so every child is able to pursue their dreams.  My daughters were let down by this broken promise, but I'm going to do everything I can to make good on this promise, for future students, because they deserve a Michigan where they can receive an affordable degree, stay in Michigan and succeed.  As your next state representative, I won't just \u001ffight to invest in our children's future, I'm going to work, day-and-night, to help elect fellow lawmakers, from Menominee to Monroe, who value a quality, affordable education as much as our communities do.",

        "Text": "Here's an idea...lets vote in a Sheriff who understands what it means to be a deputy, and who has lived it and breathed it in about every circumstance imaginable over 23 years.  Because there is a difference between city policing and rural law enforcement, and it is in the experience, the attitude and the reliance on oneself and ones' neighbors.  Because the difference plays out in how we treat each other, or how we don't.  We need a Sheriff who appreciates the differences in skill sets, communications and self-reliance and is a master of all.  It's time we get back to \"sheriffin,\" not just settling for \"the way things have always been,\" or \"not great but good enough.\"  Deputies are part of a heritage stretching back to before the Magna Carta, when the \"reeve\" was the administrative / legal officer of a \"shire,\" a collection of communities of a certain size in Anglo-Saxon England. Shire-reeve...sheriff.  That tradition was brought to colonial America in the 1630s and moved west with our frontier ancestors.  I am honored to be part of the legacy of Sheriff Joseph Meek, who 175 years ago was the first Sheriff of Clackamas County when it was part of Oregon Country.  At that time Clackamas County stretched from roughly the 43rd Parallel near Salem to the 54th Parallel (what is now the top half of Oregon and much of Idaho, including all of Washington except the peninsula and coast, and well north into British Columbia). Its eastern border was the continental divide in the Rockies, while at the west was the border of Tuality County...a few miles from where Wahkiakum County is now.  At one time the residents of Clackamas and Wahkiakum Counties were across-the-fence neighbors!  Sheriff Meek brought people together for real, needed change, taking our home from \"Oregon Country\" to \"Oregon Territory,\" then to statehood for three states.  I share a philosophy with Joe Meek: Get out there, get people together, get involved, get good work done and identify the next challenge!  Sheriff Joe Meek made the transition to lawman politician for the best of reasons and so must I; I see the pressing need in the community I love and am called to serve.  I never thought I would seek office or be \"a politician\" - I see myself as a cop, a crime solver and preserver of the peace!  But a politician serves the \"polity\" - our organized society and the people who create it.  Like Joseph Meek, I will work for a safer community that values individual freedoms, protects the vulnerable and comes together to solve problems in that frontier spirit of resourcefulness.  Like him, I will serve humbly and remain accessible to you, my neighbors.  I will remain mindful that the power my deputies and I use to uphold the law comes from you, our citizens, and is exercised on your behalf, not mine.  The public trust on which we depend is fragile and must be preserved, carefully guarded and never taken for granted.  My deputies and I will be accountable to and involve YOU, our neighbors, in problem identification, prioritization and innovative problem solving.  Like our frontier Sheriff's of the 19th and 20th Centuries, I need your help to be able to make a difference in our community.  I need your involvement in this election, just like I will need your involvement in our daily law enforcement work.  I need you to stand up for what you know is right and speak out about what you expect from your law enforcement...and dare to expect more!  I need you to speak up!  I will always uphold your right to speak freely, whether I agree with you or not - how else are we to work together on problems?  I need you to care about the truth - don't be swayed by gossip, but instead do your own research; ask hard questions and expect straight answers!  If anybody reading this has a hard question for me, I am happy to meet you in person, so you can look me in the eye and make up your own mind about whether I am your kind of Sheriff.   We need your vote.  By \"we,\" I mean all your neighbors, me included.  Participation in the democratic process is vital to our community's future, and your vote in both the primary and general elections can make a huge difference in what you experience from your government.  I ask you for the chance to serve you with honor, integrity and transparency.  From me and the deputies who serve you, you can expect forward progress in the way we serve you; professionalism in the way we treat you and perform our duties, and accountability to you on the basis for our decisions and the results you may expect.   Please vote in the primary, and please vote Graham Phalen for Wahkiakum County Sheriff.",

Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court earlier this month, Rabbi Dr. Shmuly Yanklowitz was disturbed to read about one of the judge's more controversial rulings. The case involved a defunct kosher meatpacking company Rav Shmuly Yanklowitz knew well, the New York-based Agriprocessors. The company's treatment of undocumented workers created a scandal within the Orthodox Jewish community a decade ago, when Rabbi-Shmuly Yanklowitz was a rabbinical student concerned with social justice.   During a 2008 labor dispute, a federal appeals court ruled that Agriprocessors had to bargain with a group of workers at a Brooklyn distribution facility who had voted to unionize. But Kavanaugh penned a dissent siding with Agriprocessors, arguing that most of the employees in the election were ineligible to unionize because they were undocumented.  The ruling bothers labor law experts for the way it bucks long-standing federal policy. It bothers Yanklowitz because he had met face to face with Agriprocessors employees and understood their plight.   \"I was quite distressed to see a Supreme Court of the United States nominee with this opinion,\" Yanklowitz said. \"The notion that a fundamental right would be stripped away from undocumented workers feels to me like a cruel and unjust measure.\"   -Reported by Dave Jamieson at the Huffington Post",

The majority of people I speak with want peace of mind knowing their children will be safe in school and their families will be safe in public spaces like concerts, malls and places of worship.  Most people I have talked with, including gun owners, don't want to see our schools, shopping centers, churches, synagogues, and mosques turned into fortresses to achieve this end.  They want fewer and less lethal weapons in circulation, they want gun owners to be held accountable for securing their weapons safely, and they want the ability to temporarily remove guns from people in crisis who might use those weapons to harm themselves or others.    Unfortunately, their voices lost out today. Sen. Lavelle, the Judiciary Committee's lone swing vote on the assault weapon ban before the General Assembly, voted not to release Senate Bill 163 to the Senate floor-- thereby preventing an up-or-down vote by the Senate and effectively killing the bill. Just as bad, he is trying to avoid accountability for his vote by blaming Senate Democrats for putting the bill in his committee. Like many in this district, I'm deeply disappointed in his position and his deflection on such a gravely serious issue.",

        "Text": "Please share this with those you know in business,  marketing and with other humans as well. --  We think we've discovered something. What we've discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. Sometimes when a business discovers something, the smartest thing that business can do is keep it a secret. Then, while it's a secret, get the patents, trade marks, copyrights or whatever else it takes to own your discovery. We think this is not that kind of discovery, we think this is one of those discoveries that we are obliged to share.   I get that for so many this can seem at odds with the feeling being presented right now that this is an evenly split nation, but it really isn't. As much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is unlimited political spending that got this President and so many other Republicans elected. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but ads and comments these days are simply part of what unlimited political spending can buy, but from our experience what it isn't buying is popularity.   This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn't, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves.   The second came with us pointing out that whatever the results turn out to be the President only has himself to blame for the Russia probe because: \"Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country's top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.\"  The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with those orders we get comments like: \"Don't mix business and politics, Bill. It's bad for the bottom line.\" \"I was taught years ago, you don't mix politics or religion with your business.\" But look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales!  And there will be those who say, \"Of course you get great results, but you're just giving stuff away.\" Yes, that is true, but this chart is sales in dollars, not simply the number of orders vs last year. I think a lot of this is about intention. We really do see cooking as this act of kindness that Cooks do which sets a better future in motion. For us it's clear that cooking is where our humanity comes from. In this almost one million years we've been gathering together around the fire to share food we've learned the greatest lesson, that strength does not come from the ability to drive others away, true strength comes from the compassion to let others in.  Cooks give away meals made with love freely. That we, as a business of and for Cooks, get to sometimes give away Spices freely makes me happy. That you can be a good customer of Penzeys without ever spending a dollar with us so very much fits the spirit of our customers. Yes, if no one spent money with us we'd be out of business, but that's not the way humans work. We are proud that those who have a hard time justifying the cost of Spices in their budget can get great tastiness in their life without spending anything. We are also appreciative of those who can pick up a little gift or a couple items to help make all this work.  In our experience we've found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters.  If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the attacks on human decency the Republicans have been committing, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than now. Your country needs you.   And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it's time to stop saying young people can't be reached and instead try to get your clients to look into the values young people demand. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by putting him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives.   There's talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. A big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity -- how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy.  Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that's a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It's time for America to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we've been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work, very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind.  And for us, we are trying to figure out the flat weeks between pyramid peaks. We are in that spot where just doing what we do best for 18 hours means going silent for the next three weeks while we struggle to get six weeks worth of orders out. I think we are figuring this out. And as we've been quiet for a few weeks now, maybe the next big thing is coming soon. If your not yet on our mailing list now might be the time to click this link and take care of that: http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html  Now might be the time to share this with family and friends to give them a chance to sign up too. Our free giveaways are some pretty nice things to experience.   Spend every day like it's November 6th.  Happy America's Birthday!  Bill Penzey  bill@penzeys.com",

That's some expensive road.  This project has been in design since 2004, first in the CIP in 2000.  How has the traffic changed in this half mile in 18 years?  A design cost of $3.15 million is roughly enough fee to keep a consulting firm of 31.5 people busy for an entire year.  How many engineers and designers did this half mile of road get?  3 years, 3 months, and 15 days to construct this half mile road project?  I know it would be a terrible hassle for travelers, but wouldn't about a year of the road completely shut down, and get the project done with quickness, be a more reasonable solution?  The Housing Resource Center is set to open in about 2 months.  The road construction will continue for almost another two years.  Anyway, Aragona Village, I hope that info helps!",
