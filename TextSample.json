Actual and perceived institutional racism has led to the rise of movements such as Black Lives Matter. The 2016 election campaign has brought many deep seeded prejudices in some parts of the nation back into the public spotlight.  Recently, there has been a push to remove many statues and memorials of the American Civil War from public display.   The question: Is removing these reminders of America's tumultuous history effective? What are the potential long term effects? Additionally, what would be the most effective means of confronting America's strained racial relationships?

        "Text": "Pick your flavor of the Rainbow--Celebrate Equality $7.49 value Rainbow Spice, yours w $5 purchase!-- Please take the news of these last few weeks of what the Republican Party has done to heart, but please don't despair, if only because there is no value in despair. As much as the story right now seems to be a morally unmoored President, the real story is how unlimited political spending and shameless propaganda have turned the Republican Party and Republican voters against everything they once believed in.  Imagine, it was only just three years ago this week that the Supreme Court made Marriage Equality the law of the land. Back then we lived in a place where the majority of those serving on the highest court of our land thought it was their job to protect equality, not just for the majority or for the privileged in their party, but for all Americans. Seems like it will be a long time before we get back to a separate but equal judicial branch of our government that holds this country to the most American of ideals--that all here are born equal, with equal rights. While we still can, through Sunday July 1st we are celebrating the goodness and decency of American Marriage Equality with an offer of the Rainbow Spice of your choice, an up to $7.49 value, with any $5 purchase.  We here in Wisconsin, for some time now, along with those in Missouri and North Carolina, have had to live through being the test grounds for what is currently happening on a national level. At first, even after the election results, you want to tell yourself this is somehow not real and there's only so much damage they can do.  But then one week you wake up to photo ops of the children of legitimate asylum seekers locked away from their parents. And then next you realize that our courts are being stacked with judges whose only real qualification is a willingness to deny our nation's fundamental equality to anyone deemed to be at odds with the President's agenda. That's the day you realize not just that it really can happen here, but that it already has.  And to those in the established media and to the longtime political leaders of the left calling for civility and mutual respect, I can tell you from experience--No; very seriously, NO. Yes, there is still a great deal of decency within most Republican voters, but in their candidates and in the Fox and am radio propaganda outlets that support them, there is no decency there. As much as their voters may be misled and confused, those misleading them know exactly what they are doing and exactly why they are doing it.  Wisconsin lost a good two years and a recall election to allowing the whole \"I agree with what you are doing, but just not the way you are going about it\" argument to flourish. Unlimited political spending buys a lopsided number of ads, creating the illusion that there is popular backing of the candidates of the right. Unlimited political spending pays for all the statements in the comments sections creating the false sense that there is real support for the arguments of the right. But you only need enter the real world of marches and protests and the inescapable realities of everyday life to see for yourself that the support for the policies of the right are pretty much nonexistent.  Here I think Penzeys was a part of the turning point with our campaign for kindness. From our decades of time spent with those kind enough to cook, we just weren't buying the message that kindness belonged quietly on the sidelines. For us it was just the opposite. Ultimately our message boiled down to this: \"Kindness can't sit down simply because anger has stood up.\" This message was well received.  In 2016, through suppression and intimidation, through corruption and collusion, and through lies and propaganda, it really was possible in this country to win a majority with a minority of the voters. Please, in the weeks and months ahead, don't be deterred from radiating your kindness. November is coming. Do all you can until then to show that caring about others, especially those least privileged, is always what has made this country great. In your kindness is your strength. Don't ever let anyone convince you it is a reason to go silent. There is too much goodness at stake.  And with June being The Month of Marriage Equality, through this Sunday the first we still have some really good prices on our Love Boxes. If you have any weddings to attend this summer, now is the time to get a really good deal on a gift that means a great deal. As a Cook, you know time spent around the dinner table is where happily ever after begins. But before happily ever after can begin, people first have to be able to see the value in cooking and sharing meals together. These boxes do just that, and they do it in such a happy, tasty way.  To see love boxes please click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/.../love-15-jar-gif.../c-24/p-1746/pd-gb  No coupon or codes needed for the great prices on the Love Boxes, or for the $2 wonderful Granulated Garlic (https://www.penzeys.com/.../granulated-garli.../c-24/p-1000/pd-s) and very tasty and perfect for 4th of July grilling BBQ 3001 (https://www.penzeys.com/.../bbq-3001-seasoning/c-24/p-429/pd-s). These offers are automatic for everyone.  To get the coupon needed to receive your free choice of Rainbow Spice free with $5 spending in any of our stores, just click on this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html  Or visit us online at penzeys.com and, after reaching $5 in spending, enter the code for your choice of Rainbow Spice in the Apply Code box in your shopping basket.:  Cayenne Pepper 41854C  Penzeys Curry 12957C  Granulated Garlic 44455C  Parsley Flakes 31956C  Blue Poppy Seeds 57554C  Juniper Berries 54953C  Regular Chili Powder 11150C  No need to place the Spice in your basket separately, the code does that for you automatically and for free. It's easy. Regular shipping costs apply, but regular standard shipping is always free with only $30 spending.  And celebrate America's spirit of equality! We are in for bumpy times ahead, but for each \"win\" this administration achieves in turning back the clock of equality, it only becomes that much more loathed by the majority of Americans who will then be that much more determined to turn out in November. We will get through this and we will be a far more equal nation for what has been set in motion. They need you to despair; hell no to that. Challenge, resist, confront, because right now that's what true kindness calls for.  Bill Penzey  bill@penzeys.com  P.S. As a Spice business that believes in the values of taking care of each other found at the heart of cooking, we now fall into the \"political content\" category, which most likely means it will cost us to have our message reach people.

Immigrants crossing the border are having their children separated from them, and these children are used as political footballs to force congress to pay for a wall!     President Trump is holding these families hostage, at any cost, until he gets his way - the wall! - by enacting a cruel zero-tolerance policy for any person who crosses the border illegally, resulting in thousands of children being taken away from their parents. This is inhumane and immoral.    This administration has demonstrated a bigotry against many races, nationalities and creeds. First it was the Muslims when Trump signed an order (January 27, 2017, Executive Order, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States) temporarily halting admission of refugees from predominantly Muslim countries. Soon thereafter he refused Syrian refuges who were escaping a civil war that has been going on for more than 5 years.      Then the cancellation of DACA in September 2017, where Trump ended the program, thereby putting into jeopardy the fate of hundreds of thousands of young Americans who were brought here as young children. These are young men and women who are now working in our country, going to school, and even fighting in our armed forces. Again, if Congress agreed to a wall, Trump would have signed a bill to accept these people. The lives of these young people remain in limbo.    Continuing with the administration's expulsion of all people, other than white Christians, and keeping his xenophobic campaign promises, the administration began the assault on people who came here because of war, anarchy, murderous drug cartels, hurricanes, or other disasters in their home countries - their TPS (Temporary Protected Status) was revoked.     I wrote about this earlier this year. This status extended to Salvadorans, Hondurans, Guatemalans, and many others from troubled central American countries. Many of these people have been here for decades, raised families here, work here, and pay taxes here. Their legal status is being revoked and they face the horror of losing everything - and everyone - and being sent back to their country of origin.       Now what? Children are taken away from their parents under the administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy, and parents have been arrested. Is this the art of negotiation?     But a wall is not the answer. Secure boarders are needed along with a good immigration policy that is not forced upon Congress by keeping young Americans from citizenship and tearing children from their parents. \"America is Great\" because of the diversity in our population, not because of its inhumanity.     What is needed is aid to countries in trouble. But instead of giving aid, we threaten to cut aid, and this happened in the beginning of the year when Nikki Halley, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, scolded the countries that didn't vote with the U.S. concerning Palestinian Aid. She touted the administration's position of \"America-first\" without considering the consequences of extreme poverty, war, and strife in these countries. Instead of help, we withheld help. This makes no sense.      What is needed are safe refugee camps and safe zones in Mexico, and the Central American countries - and yes, in our country - to keep these people who are fleeing from harm's way while they wait to be processed.   What is needed are more border patrols, immigration lawyers, immigration judges, and officials who can process asylum cases.     What is needed is decriminalization of drugs. This will stop the flow of illegal drugs into our country and cut funding of the drug cartels that have killed so many people on both sides of the border.     What is needed are good trade agreements that help the workers on both sides of the border - and not only corporations.    What is needed are working permits for the millions of undocumented workers who are currently working in the United States paying taxes, raising families, buying houses. These are people who have been here for decades. They need a legal status to bring them out of underground economy that only benefits the companies that exploit them.    What is needed is to accept our role in the world, and to understand that all nations on earth must work together for all of mankind. America sent aid to many of those countries after two devastating World Wars, and that policy truly made \"America Great.\"",

The IRC is on the ground and responding as we speak, working with local partners in Boise to provide counseling and support to refugees and other members of the community shaken by this incident. We are also supporting families to find and pay for temporary housing, providing travel logistics for those needing medical care out of state, and encourage families needing other help, or afraid for their safety, to reach out at the apartment building where we are this afternoon, or come to IRC office.  IRC thanks Boise's Mayor, Police, and the community for their support of refugees. This attack does not reflect, in any way, the tremendous welcoming nature of the Boise community we have worked with so closely since opening in 2006.   It is heartbreaking to know that people and children who fled horror of war and conflict to find safety in America and the Boise community had to experience violence all over again.",

Should I win the primary election, I will be up against a 16-year incumbent with a track record for ignoring the people of our district.  This isn't just about Alabama. Out of 84 women in Congress, only four of them are under the age of 40. This is a problem. More diversity in age and thought is crucial to our nation's progress.  Having a representative who fights for government transparency, affordable healthcare, term limits, technical training and gender parity is of grave importance to us all.  We often wonder what we can do to make the world a better place. YOU can help. Even a small donation of $10 will go a long way in funding our campaign and make a huge difference in the future of our great country. Click \"Donate Now\" to get involved.

I want people to look at the information and I want them to be the judge of it for themselves. Elder abuse is like sexual abuse no one likes to talk about it it's like the white elephant in the room. I grew up with that scenario all my life and I suffered from drugs and alcohol and now have 23 years of sobriety. I was my mother's caretaker for the last 2 1/2 years of her life and I spent every day with them I know what my mother wanted. It's been noted that  my parents were not legally married I'm sorry her obituary says her 'husband Daniel' they were MARRIED for 64 years, so if these critics had all the information and read the information on this 'stalker malicious page' instead of going to the criminal they would realize that the bottom line is Benjamin Masias was Helen AND Daniels Power of Attorney and he did nothing to provide legal information to my father which is required by law I believe it's called a breach of fiduciary duties? I Welcome your comments but please read the information, I may ONLY have a high school diploma and work for Uber, but I try to educate myself before I stick my foot in my mouth! So if you want to know the history of this situation then please feel free to read ALL through my site...And the last time I heard you can pretty much post ANYTHING you want on Facebook as long as it's the TRUTH, I googled it because I only have a high school diploma but I think it's called slander and I believe you can be sued for it, and since I've been fired from every job I would Never put myself in a position of a crime of THEFT to financially ruin myself Or my fatherless grand-babies , if these individuals feel that I have slandered them Please let's go into a court of law and open up a dialogue. Let's BREAK the SILENCE! Happy Reading! ",

The return on their election meddling has been staggering to the forces of freedom everywhere.  Right now so much is at stake. Since the 2016 election, so much of the focus has been on who the Russians worked to get elected, and what they did to make his election possible. What's been lost for the most part of the coverage of Russia's meddling has been why they took the tremendous risks they took to get this president elected.   The truth is there really is a free world that America has been the leader of for coming up on 75 years. Of course this freedom was anything but free to achieve, and was instead bought at the cost of hundreds of thousands of American lives, and millions more lives of our allies. The freedom there is in the world has been maintained through these years by America's commitment to its allies to keep Russia in check in Europe and China in check in Asia.  We travel the world for great Spices so you don't have to, and as much as we want to report back to you the tremendous goodness of the people we meet in our journeys, we also want you to understand how so much of the freedom in these people's lives only exists because the leaders of their countries believe that America is a trustworthy ally. Without the unwavering belief in American support, our allies in Europe would have long ago given in to Russia's demands just as our allies in Asia would have been forced to give in to the demands of China. We can't let that happen.  Maybe, one day, we will learn what it is the leaders of Russia have on our President, and what our President has on the Republican leaders of Congress, or we may never know. What we do know is that they are all dancing to a tune that is not an American one, at least not one we want to hear. Don't let this be Bye-bye Miss American Pie. November 6 is less than four months away. As Cooks, I'm guessing you're pretty much all registered. Now's the time to give of your time and give of your dollars. Now's the time to set the world right. Please find your way to make this November 6 once again an American election.   And while I have your attention, this is where I put in a reminder that it's a good weekend to visit one of our stores, as we do our best to remind everyone of the value of our close allies with a free with $5 purchase, regularly $6.29 Quebec Beef (and so much more) Spice. Quebec is a great blend to make the most of the rest of the Summer grilling season.

To learn more about the Quebec Spice please click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/quebec-beef-spice/c-24/p-3104/pd-s  And while you are there, even though they do not directly relate to today's events, we also have our really nice Granulated Garlic and tasty BBQ 3001 for just $2 in the 1/4-cup jars.   To see our Granulated Garlic click here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/granulated-garlic-powder/c-24/p-1000/pd-s  To see our BBQ 3001 please click here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/bbq-3001-seasoning/c-24/p-429/pd-s  No coupon or code needed for the good deal on the Granulated Garlic and BBQ 3001.

Cooks share wisdom, this is always a good spot to do just that.   Now is the time to make the greatest difference. Thank you for your kind heart,  Bill Penzey  bill@penzeys.com  And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category.

TO HELP OUT: Please email my volunteer coordinator Amy Morgan at amyem2012@gmail.com if you have time to volunteer for an hour or two at one of the polling locations. All you need to do is sit or stand with a Deb sign and/or button at a certain distance away from the building (there will be a sign there marking the spot) smile, wave, and thank people for voting as they leave to get a sense of how we're doing at that polling location.  Also: Election night watch party at Crossroads on University at 7:30pm, open to the public. Come one, come all.",

        "Text": "Hi there. My name is Abdul. I became a doctor to help sick people get better, but I quickly realized I couldn't help people without digging up the roots of the problem. So I took a job as Detroit Health Commissioner. I used my position to fight for children being poisoned by toxic waste, and stand up to oil companies to reduce air pollution. I was able to introduce the first city-wide lead testing program for our public schools.  Now I'm running for governor. Why would a doctor run for governor? Well, it's simple. Too many of my friends and family in Michigan are unhealthy because our politics are hurting them. We have a system that puts corporate profits over people.  They can't see a doctor because we don't have universal healthcare. The big pharmaceutical companies and health insurance companies are raking in the dough, but our communities are suffering. Our air and water are poisoned by the oil industry. And few can afford fair housing in an economy that doesn't offer people a fair $15 minimum wage.  I have spent a lot of time detailing where I stand on the issues on my website - I hope you'll take a look. As a doctor, I believe we need a Medicare for All-like system in Michigan. I'm running on an agenda to win equal pay for women, a massive investment in rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, and universal pre-K for all our kids. I'm for a $15 minimum wage, an end to the corrupting influence of money in our politics, and bold action on climate change.  Today I'm asking for your support. We are running against millionaire candidates with big money behind their campaigns and politicians who are content doing the corporations' bidding. We don't take corporate money.  They may have their powerful political networks and their corporate donors, but we have you - the people. If everyone who sees this post backs our campaign, we will win. I hope you'll join us.",

Since Suozzi votes along with Pelosi pretty much all of the time, I can say with confidence that Suozzi will vote to increase your taxes, just like he has done every single time he had the chance when he was in charge.

Why?\" - Paulette Weisberg  \"Almost 200 million wild animals are killed by hunters in the United States each year. Many if not most of those animals are not killed for meat or in order to prevent starvation, control disease, protect communities from dangerous animals or for any of the other reasons 'sport' hunters often use to try to justify their activities. Those animals are killed because the 'sport' hunters like to kill animals. Why else would poaching be so rampant and canned hunting be so popular?\" - Christopher Nicholson  \"Two-thirds of people in the United States oppose trophy hunting. Then why does the federal government permit it on public lands? And why does the government permit canned hunting when three-quarters of people oppose it -- including many hunters?\" - Laurence Branning  \"Poaching is rampant here in the United States as well as in Africa. Experts estimate that less than five percent of poachers in this country are caught and at least as many wild animals are killed illegally as are killed legally. I call upon the government to start enforcing the hunting regulations much more vigorously so that the killing is at least done within the law.\" - Edward Parchese  Information about related issues, related news, facts, quotes, what you can do and more: http://www.animalmatters.org/",

This upends immigration law - the right to seek asylum is a fundamental part of U.S. law. The ruling overturns precedent which permitted abuse victims to obtain asylum in the United States and may block tens of thousands of victims of violence and persecution if there's no court or congressional intervention.   These vulnerable communities have nowhere else to turn and their government won't support them. We should support and provide safety for these women and children who seek asylum from violence. Rejecting them goes against everything we stand for. Add your name to call on Congress to grant domestic abuse and gang violence survivors asylum in the U.S.",

We still have to remember, as hard as it may be to do so, that all cops are not bad, and we need them in our lives. If you think certain neighborhoods are bad now, then try living in a world with no laws or law enforcement presence. We would have a constant state of anarchy and lawlessness that threatens the physical security of people, property and the normal, everyday rights and peace of mind of ALL citizens. I don't know about you, but I sure as hell would not want to deal with that. Ya feel me?       Yes we know some cops are lousy human beings in uniform, but a lot of the people who hate them are the same people who actually commit crime(s) and the same people who would hurt you or me. We have cops, laws and a government for a reason Black people. The system as  a whole is not perfect, but we would really be in some deep crap without it. Let us try and remember this much as we continue to support the Black Lives Matter movement.  Peace",

This means that too many churches are not ready to serve those considering abortion in their pews.   James 1:27 compels us to care for orphans and widows. Accordingly, God created His church to fight to protect the unborn and build strong families. In this fight, love is our weapon and the gospel our first priority.  The high numbers of Christians having abortions are a challenge and an opportunity for your church to become more actively involved. Your role is essential in saving the unborn from abortion, and connecting lost women and men facing unplanned and/or unwanted pregnancies with the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Learn how you can help your church become a place of compassion, hope, and help for those considering abortion - to make your church \"abortion ready\" with our simple six step process.  Sign up for free and our team of trained coaches will guide you through the process of making abortion unthinkable in your church.",

        "Text": "Because Immigrants Are People! Until 10AM Pacific 5.25.18 All 3 Free! A $28.39 Value! Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman went on to personally pick the vice presidential candidate, who then went on during the transition to pick a literal Russian agent as our country's top national security advisor, despite being explicitly warned about his past.  Our offer is in support of America's immigrant population, but the reason the President took the time out of his day to call a group of immigrants animals was to distract from the investigation into Russian involvement. Every story about the investigation needs to start with the above reminder.  In times of inhumanity, the super-humanizing of cooking matters more than ever. The kindness of Cooks sets better futures in motion. Working to care for those around us has always been what makes this country great.  Last week Wednesday, the same day as the scheduled release of the Senate's bi-partisan findings on Russian election interference, the White House used all the stagecraft it could muster for a conversation on Californian immigrant youth gangs. The Senators announced: \"The Russian effort was extensive, sophisticated, and ordered by President Putin himself for the purpose of helping Donald Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton.\" The president once again playing to his base announced, \"These aren't people. These are animals.\" If you even glanced at the news since, you saw which announcement got all the attention.  Yes, all youth gang crime is bad, but there was no reason to focus on strictly immigrant youth gangs. There has been no upsurge in immigrant crime, or reason this should be taking the President's limited hours away from the nuclear issues in Korea and Iran. It doesn't take much cynicism to see this was never about overcoming the issues that cause disadvantaged youths to find belonging in gangs. I'm pretty sure history will judge this to be just one more chance for the President to rally his supporters by promoting fear of immigrants, especially Hispanic immigrants. And that's wrong.   Immigrants are not America's weakness, immigrants are our strength. Browse our website and you will be hard-pressed to find anything that was not brought to our shelves as a gift from immigrants. In the desire to pass on the dishes of kindness and caring of their youth to their new families and communities, immigrants blessed America with the greatest diversity of flavor any nation has ever known. We are grateful.   In these last months we've discovered a good message travels far, but a good message with a great offer has the possibility of reaching everywhere. With just how important it is for all of us to show support for our immigrant community, right now this seems like a time for a great offer.   So for one night only, in support of all the immigrants have brought to America, we are offing you three Spices of your choice. As much as we tried to make this offer work for our stores, there was no way way on short notice to have this offer not gridlock them. So I apologize, but this offer is only good online from now until 10am Pacific Time tomorrow, Friday 5.25.18. To try to make up for this not being in the stores, we've reduced the minimum for free shipping lower than we ever have before to just $15. I hope this helps.   We also tried to make this truly your choice of any 1/4-cup jar, 1/2-cup jar and 3/4 cup bag, but the nearly 600 coupon codes made the website really sluggish. So we based the possible choices on previous \"your choice\" offers. We are giving you the choice of the most popular items which are pretty much the most expensive ones. I get it, I love our Basil, but I'm not going to use my coupon for that when I also need some equally tasty, but slightly more expensive Garlic.  To see the list of possible free jars please click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/pages/top-20-jars/  To see the list of possible free bags click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/pages/top-20-bags/  To get your up to $28.39 worth of 3 Free Spices and/or Seasonings, just visit us at penzeys.com and simply enter your three choices (one each of each of the three sizes) into the apply code box at checkout.   There's no need to enter the items separately into your basket, the codes if entered into the apply codes box at checkout do that for you for free! There is no code needed for the free shipping with just $15 in spending, that one's automatic for everyone. It's easy, but don't delay. This is only good until 10am Pacific Time 5.25.18.   Please feel free to share this post to those who might enjoy its message and its offer. We are keeping our fingers crossed about how this is all going to go on our website. We are pretty certain we are not as popular as an Elton John concert ticket release yet, but if we cross that threshold tonight, please try back later tonight or early tomorrow when things should have quieted down.   In closing, I would like to praise the President for his support for our country's law enforcement on the county level last Wednesday; it was good to see. It would be good to see that same support on the federal level. His attacks on federal law enforcement officials, calling into question the loyalty of those who have given a lifetime of dedication and duty to our country, are every bit as wrong as his attacks on our country's immigrant community.   Even if it is ultimately proven that there was no collusion or corruption on the President's part, these investigations still have to happen because he did not do a decent job of vetting the people around him. This investigation is no one's doing but his own. At the heart of conservative values is the belief in taking responsibility for one's actions. Our country could really use our President to embrace this core conservative value right now.

Dr. David Johnson and his team of Trustees, and Dr. Twyla Wells and the JCC Foundation Board of Directors continue to move our community college forward in many creative ways.  Recently on another very hot summer afternoon I was given the opportunity by JCC to represent the NC House and our collaborative work at the dedication of the new Tactical Training Facility at Howell Woods. The new facility allows for live ammunition training with the state of the art \"shoot house\" and fortified perimeter. The catwalk allows for instructor observation.  I felt like I was on the \"Seal Team\".  It was my humble honor to speak along with Sheriff Steve Bizzel.  I was able to share my ongoing work with law enforcement and bills that have been approved to continue to assist them as they protect us. Dr. Johnson also announced the $200,000 that I was able to fund to JCC that will build a new fire tower for training the Fire Academy students from across the county. This will help every fire department in the county to keep new recruits in the pipeline. Partnering with JCC to build the Tactile Training Center and the Student Service Center as well as the Tart Building Restoration are Donnie and Linda Lassiter. Thank you, Lassiter family, for your generous contributions to JCC.",

That's why special interests have spent over $11 MILLION to beat her.  We're fighting back with grassroots power but that takes all of us pitching in. Will you give $5, or whatever you can afford, to make sure Tammy has the resources she needs to get reelected and help take back the Senate in 2018?",

Isabella, who is legally blind, requires a little extra attention and Mrs. Harding has always been there to help and seems to truly care for her well being. From giving her a much needed hug when she's feeling emotional or overwhelmed, to making sure she gets into the correct car at the end of the day. She was there throughout the year, inspiring and coaching. She does an amazing job of getting students excited about learning by coming up with fun and unique ways of teaching. Our daughter has found at an early age the passion for reading and we love that Mrs. Harding has been there helping to support our child's education and passion for knowledge.   We are the parents of three children in the Pasco County Schools and we want nothing more than to have Megan Harding on our School board advocating for our children.\"  Mr. & Mrs. Correll Parents",

        "Text": "This week, The Rutherford Institute secured a rare and critical Fourth Amendment victory before the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled 8-1 in Collins v. Virginia that police need a warrant to search vehicles on private property. At a time when the Fourth Amendment has been so watered down, battered and bruised (owing to the general complacency of the courts and legislatures) as to provide little practical protection against police abuses, this ruling is a welcome reprieve.   Still, we can only achieve these victories with your help. Right now, The Rutherford Institute has until June 30 (our fiscal year end) to raise $100,000 for a matching gift campaign, and we are looking to our core supporters to help us meet this critical goal and, at the same time, double the impact of your donation.   To make a tax-deductible donation to The Rutherford Institute, click the link below, visit us online at www.rutherford.org, donate using PayPal, call in your donation to 800-225-1791, or mail your donation to our headquarters at PO Box 7482, Charlottesville, VA 22906. Thank you, in advance, for your support of The Rutherford Institute's efforts to stand strong in defense of the Constitution and the principles on which this nation was founded.",

In Alabama, 12% of all pregnancies are aborted. It's easy to sit back and say, \"We can't do anything about that.  We just need the Supreme Court to overturn Roe Vs. Wade\", but that's not entirely true.  Here are 5 ways we can take action NOW to save lives:  #1. Defund Planned Parenthood at the Federal and State levels.  #2. Oppose all abortion funding, including through government-mandated health insurance coverage.  #3. Oppose euthanasia in its various forms, including physician-assisted suicide. (Being pro-life isn't all about babies. It covers a wide range from conception to natural death.)  #4. Oppose embryonic stem cell research that requires the destruction of a fetus. #5. Require mandatory waiting periods and require that ultrasounds of the fetus be shown to the mother.  Now I realize that as Probate Judge, I will not have the opportunity to vote on pro-life issues.  I fully understand the duties of the job. However, the Probate Judge will interact with local legislators on a routine basis. I can promise you that I will lobby, promote, and support all pro-life legislation to the best of my ability.  My conscience requires it, and my faith demands it.

        "Text": "Prison Reform Part 2 - Institutionalized Incarceration: The never ending cycle  When I think about imprisonment and the intent behind it, i can't help but to feel like we are failing some of those that are behind bars unnecessarily.  Prisons/Jails are intended to be a punishment or a way to discipline adults that have violated constitutional law.    It doesn't make sense to me that we would discipline our kids one way, our adults a completely different way and then scratch our heads because we can't figure out what is going on. I have often wondered if this was one reason why our prison systems have such poor rates with rehabilitating parolees successfully into society.   When I think about what it means to discipline a child, I would say in general it is intended for them to reflect on their actions in order for them to gain a better sense of moral direction that will hopefully influence them to make a better decision in the same or similar circumstance later on.  However, I can never recall a time that I locked up any of my kids (12, 9, almost 2) and treated them the way we currently treat those incarcerated.  Now don't get me wrong; there are some very very bad people out there and they need to be locked up somewhere far away.  But I firmly believe that the way our current prison systems are being ran are making the problem worse.  We need to stop letting prisons be ran like a for-profit doggy daycare.  They they are charging us to keep people behind bars like they are some sort of dangerous animal that has to be caged.    What I'm saying is that we should be treating and housing those that have committed crimes like they are being disciplined with a focus on learning additional mental health and labor skills.  But instead we are focused on punishment and the physical/mental degradation of inmates.    Let me know if you guys agree that: 1.  We need to get the profits out of the prison systems especially since we the tax payers are footing the bill. 2.  The poor environment that our fellow citizens are subjected to is creating a continuation released inmates to fail to reintegrate as contributing members of society successfully. 3.  Because of #2 this is creating a more deadly and lethal inmate society and internal network.  If you're with me and agree we need to make some changes then like, share, follow this page.    The thing that helps us grow the most is when you as the follower invite \"like minded friends\" to this page.  There is a link on my page that helps you to do this.",

Cuts in BUDGETS mean less chance of a full staff, and entering a dangerous situation without another officer as backup.  3.  Cuts in PAY mean those who protect us have a full-time, high-risk job, and then a part-time job to make ends meet.  4.  The state cutting funds to mental health and addiction means people who should be patients are now filling our jails.  5.  We would all be safer with a statewide uniform crime reporting system like NIBRS to save property and lives. (Unfortunately, the leaders decided to spend $350,000 on another study.

I will always work to make our community and state stronger and by bringing labor and business leaders together great things can and will happen.

        "Text": "For the Love of Humanity at the Heart of Cooking.  Flat-out Free $31.95 Hope box w Mexican Vanilla! Plus Free shipping w $20(not $30) spending!  -- Three years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including these words: \"Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border.\" No one with any sense of history had any doubts about who he was channeling.   No future historian of 21st century America will be so unaware of 20th century history to not know exactly who the then candidate was channeling with the words \"tremendous infectious disease.\" At the time, many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded field. But if there was then any doubt or feeling this was just an act, on this the third anniversary of his launching his campaign with such calculated words, that doubt is long gone. There is also no doubt that the threat this kind of thinking represents is very much real.   Even though our country since it's founding has been a revolution for equality, there has still always been racism in America. And there's something about immigration that continues to  bring out the worst in some Americans. But as bad as racism is, as bad as the belief that some people are better than other people is, the belief that some people are not people at all is far-far worse, and much more dangerous to our country. That these beliefs are coming from the President of the United States and are being intentionally spread to promote anger and fear is something no American, regardless of Party, should ever be willing to accept.   So today and tomorrow (July 6 & 7) we are spotlighting the danger of supporting this President while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and Party seek to dehumanize with a free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box. We are an immigrant nation, and through the strength of that immigration we've risen up from just another colony to leadership among the free world. This little boxes packs in a great deal of the goodness this latest wave of immigrants have brought to our country.   To see the Embrace Hope Box please click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hope-gift-box/c-24/p-3152/pd-gb  First there is the Embrace Hope Pin. One of the greatest gifts America receives from each new wave of immigrants is an ever refreshing sense of hope. From our Spice travels we can tell you the Hope Americans take for granted is far more rare in most other places around the globe. To see America through the eyes of immigrants is to see an almost magical place where, no matter who you were born, your hard work can amount to something, and even better, a place where your children have an honest opportunity to earn a better future. To see America through their eyes is to see the Hope that has served our nation so well in tines like these where we had lost our way.   Then Mexican Vanilla Extract. It is a small bottle, yes, but it is the now sky high cost of the Vanilla in this little bottle that makes this box our costliest giveaway ever. But to be able to give Vanilla in this time when so many on budgets struggle to afford its costs does make us happy. And it belongs here. Almost everything Americans bake to share love features Vanilla, and Vanilla only exists because of the ingenuity, hard work and compassion of the ancestors of those from Mexico and Central America that makes it so right to be a part of this offer. It's a small bottle, but there is so much goodness inside.   Plus Salsa & Pico. Great flavor comes from great culture, those decades, even generations, of kind Cooks working and observing and making those little tweaks in order to achieve smiles all the way around the table is where the best of flavors come from. That the President and his Party should seek to dehumanize people of a culture that so values children, the elderly and, of course, cooking makes it all the more wrong. This Salsa & Pico has the ability to turn every fresh tomato or ear of corn you meet for the rest of the summer into a reminder of how lucky we are to live among those with such great humanity and who care so much about making the lives of others better.  And with the Kind Heart Magnet and Recipe Cards. Once you have the Embrace Hope Recipe Card you might want to share it as well so here is that link: https://www.penzeys.com/media/8259/embrace_hope_tip_card_v2_07_06_18.pdf  Please take a moment to celebrate the kindness they bring, appreciate how much they've given up to be here, and embrace the hope at the heart of their journey. They are our future. Now is the time to thank them.  To get your flat-out free $31.95 value Embrace Hope box in one of our stores, get your in-store coupon here by clicking this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html  Or visit us online at penzeys.com and simply enter the code \"America\" in the apply code box at checkout. No need to add the box to your basket, the code does that automatically, and for free. Shipping charges will still apply, but to try to make this a bit more obtainable we've dropped our standard $30 spending minimum for free shipping to just $20 and included Alaska and Hawaii in this offer-- I hope it helps.  We are also offering a good deal on 1/4-cup jars of Ground Cumin and Chicken Taco Seasoning. Our Ground Cumin is something special and key to many traditional Mexican and Central American favorites. The Chicken Taco, though equal parts evolved and traditional, is the Penzey home favorite Taco Seasoning. And don't let the name fool you, whatever you have around the house can quickly become tasty tacos with Chicken Taco Seasoning. We are trying to make it easy for you to spend a little with $2 jars, or free if you spend a little more.   For more on Ground Cumin click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/cumin-ground/c-24/p-937/pd-s  For more on Chicken Taco please click here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/chicken-taco-seasoning/c-24/p-516/pd-s  And the time has come to end the dehumanization of Central American asylum seekers. They are not bringing great disease, they are not animals, they do not deserve to have their children taken from them. Much of the instability they are fleeing has been of our own making. We need to step up here and do what's right.   As we've discovered, a good message travels far, but a good message along with a great deal has the possibility of reaching everywhere. And please share this offer and if you are coming into one of our stores bring friends and family with you, especially those who might have a hard time affording Vanilla right now. It is a one per household deal, and everyone needs to have there own coupon for in-store redemption, but not too many rules or hoops to jump through for an actually free, really nice and valuable little box of brightness. There is so much humanity inside.  Once again to get your in-store coupon click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html  Nazism has no place in America or any country. These people are not animals. They are good and kind. They are our neighbors and they need our help. Let's step up and be Americans here. As Cooks have always known, in our kindness is our strength.  Thanks for having the kindness to cook,  Bill Penzey  bill@penzeys.com",
