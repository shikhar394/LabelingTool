Only prompt intervention by authorities and his keepers kept this majestic animal from being killed.   Animals have been banned from circuses in many European countries due to research that shows how circus situations are traumatic for all animals, in particular highly intelligent and social animals such as elephants. These animals should not be kept in enclosures in which they can barely turn, with extremely limited social interactions (if any!) and working as slaves for humans from their birth to their death.   We therefore ask Germany to follow the lead of other European countries and end animal slavery now, banning animals for being used and abused in circuses.   Enough is Enough!",

If you're in downtown Boston for the festivities be sure to make time for the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston exhibit '(un)expected families' that includes work from Lexington's own Zoe Perry-Wood.  Closer to home LexPride is hosting Pride Story Time for Kids at Cary Memorial Library this morning (Saturday) and an Ice Cream Social on Sunday on the Visitors' Center lawn.  This year's Boston Pride theme is \"Rainbow Resistance\" and is a call for every segment of our community to unite in the resistance against the oppression and backwards policies of the current administration in Washington, DC, the systemic threats to communities of color and trans people in our country, and the potential repeal of trans equality legislation in Massachusetts.  Join me on June 13th for Freedom for All Massachusetts's Public Education Phone Bank to protect transgender people from discrimination in public spaces.  We need more acceptance, not fear.",

Even with good insurance from her job, without Medicaid, she would be struggling each month to pay the rent and other bills.    FAST FACT: Medicaid covers nearly half of children in the U.S. who have special health care needs.  During 2016, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program covered about half (48%) of the estimated 14 million children with special health care needs in the U.S. About 7% of those children are covered by a combination of Medicaid, CHIP and private insurance. The care and services Medicaid provides often allow children with chronic health issues to live at home, where they can thrive with their families. Because Medicaid is a federal-state partnership program, each state decides what coverage is available to children who qualify.",

Since 2012, ICE has released from its custody more than 1,480 people after investigating their citizenship claims, according to agency figures. And a Times review of Department of Justice records and interviews with immigration attorneys uncovered hundreds of additional cases in the country's immigration courts in which people were forced to prove they are Americans and sometimes spent months or even years in detention.  Victims include a landscaper snatched in a Home Depot parking lot in Rialto and held for days despite his son's attempts to show agents the man's U.S. passport; a New York resident locked up for more than three years fighting deportation efforts after a federal agent mistook his father for someone who wasn't a U.S. citizen; and a Rhode Island housekeeper mistakenly targeted twice, resulting in her spending a night in prison the second time even though her husband had brought her U.S. passport to a court hearing.\" #defineamerican #isthisapigeon #dankmemes #policestate #abolishice #heretostay #makeamericagreatagain #immigrantsmakeamericagreat #undocumented #undocumentedandunafraid #undocumedia",

The return on their election meddling has been staggering to the forces of freedom everywhere.  Right now so much is at stake. Since the 2016 election, so much of the focus has been on who the Russians worked to get elected, and what they did to make his election possible. What's been lost for the most part of the coverage of Russia's meddling has been why they took the tremendous risks they took to get this president elected.   The truth is there really is a free world that America has been the leader of for coming up on 75 years. Of course this freedom was anything but free to achieve, and was instead bought at the cost of hundreds of thousands of American lives, and millions more lives of our allies. The freedom there is in the world has been maintained through these years by America's commitment to its allies to keep Russia in check in Europe and China in check in Asia.  We travel the world for great Spices so you don't have to, and as much as we want to report back to you the tremendous goodness of the people we meet in our journeys, we also want you to understand how so much of the freedom in these people's lives only exists because the leaders of their countries believe that America is a trustworthy ally. Without the unwavering belief in American support, our allies in Europe would have long ago given in to Russia's demands just as our allies in Asia would have been forced to give in to the demands of China. We can't let that happen.  Maybe, one day, we will learn what it is the leaders of Russia have on our President, and what our President has on the Republican leaders of Congress, or we may never know. What we do know is that they are all dancing to a tune that is not an American one, at least not one we want to hear. Don't let this be Bye-bye Miss American Pie. November 6 is less than four months away. As Cooks, I'm guessing you're pretty much all registered. Now's the time to give of your time and give of your dollars. Now's the time to set the world right. Please find your way to make this November 6 once again an American election.   And while I have your attention, this is where I put in a reminder that it's a good weekend to visit one of our stores, as we do our best to remind everyone of the value of our close allies with a free with $5 purchase, regularly $6.29 Quebec Beef (and so much more) Spice.

Early voting begins July 13 and continues through July 28. The election is August 2.  Thank you for your vote and support!  goo.gl/NNYYiu  #WinWithWebb [?]",

        "Text": "A New World Order: Brought to You by the Global-Industrial Deep State By John W. Whitehead  The U.S. government is operating under a New World Order government--a power elite conspiring to rule the world--and it is being brought to you by the Global-Industrial Deep State, a powerful cabal made up of international government agencies and corporations. Wait. Just hear me out. This is not the stuff of conspiracy theory, I promise, although I have lived long enough to see many so-called conspiracy theories turn into cold, hard fact. Given all that we know about the U.S. government--that it treats its citizens like faceless statistics and economic units to be bought, sold, bartered, traded, and tracked; that it repeatedly breaks the laws, overreaches its authority, and abuses its power at almost every turn; and that it wages wars for profit, and jails its own people for profit--it is not a stretch to suggest that the government has been overtaken by global industrialists that do not have our best interests at heart.   Consider the extent to which our lives and liberties are impacted by an international convergence of governmental and profit-driven interests in the surveillance state, the military industrial complex, the private prison industry, the intelligence sector, the technology sector, the telecommunications sector, the transportation sector, and the pharmaceutical industry. All of these sectors are dominated by mega-corporations operating on a global scale and working through government channels to increase their profit margins and influence everything from legislative policies to economics to environmental issues to medical care. The U.S. government's deep-seated and, in many cases, top secret alliances with foreign nations and global corporations are redrawing the boundaries of our world (and our freedoms) and altering the playing field faster than we can keep up.   It is as yet unclear whether the American Police State answers to the Global-Industrial Deep State, or whether the Global-Industrial Deep State merely empowers the American Police State. However, there is no denying the extent to which they are intricately and symbiotically enmeshed and interlocked. This marriage of governmental and corporate interests is the very definition of fascism. Where we go wrong is in underestimating the threat of fascism: it is no longer a national threat but has instead become a global menace. On almost every front, whether it's the war on drugs, or the sale of weapons, or regulating immigration, or establishing prisons, or advancing technology, if there is a profit to be made and power to be amassed, you can bet that the government and its global partners have already struck a deal that puts the American people on the losing end of the bargain. Rest assured that the U.S. government will not save us from the chains of the Global-Industrial Deep State and its New World Order.  Click below to read more. And as always, please help us speak truth to power: like, share, comment and donate to The Rutherford Institute to keep this good work going.",

I am running to replace him in Congress, it is going to be a tough fight but I know I can win. Unfortunately, he recently raised $2.25 million from Republican millionaire and billionaires and unless you step up I won't be able to compete with his ONSLAUGHT of negative ads this summer and fall.

The PET scan she had was clean so they found no other traces of cancer anywhere else.  They are faced with trying to find the funds for the extensive treatments ahead and are dependent on charity care as she is self employed with no insurance.  Please keep her in your thoughts and consider a donation if you have not already.  Thank you!   Deb is home waiting for beginning of chemo and radiation treatments on both lung and brain.  Please keep her in your prayers that she responds well to treatments.  Mike Bowe and his wife, Debbie, are two of my closest friends. I love these two people and so do my daughters. They are Aunt Deb and Uncle Mike to them. Debbie is in the hospital with some serious medical issues. They are without health insurance due to no fault of their own. They really need help for a very long road ahead for Debbie. Please read and if possible, make a donation. ANY amount helps. Thank you!  UPDATE:  Deb has been discharged and is now home.  We have confirmation that it is non-small cell carcinoma in her lung.  Waiting on biopsy confirmation that tumors are the same.  Will update once we have more info.  Keep the prayers and support coming!  Thank you!!",

It's about grassroots power vs. corporate power. It's about fighting for real justice reform. Any amount--even $5--matters because this campaign's strength isn't just in how much we raise, but in how many people like you chip in. Each of us--including you--has a role to play in taking on the corruption of the political and financial establishment. And if we're all in this fight together, we will win.   Will you make a contribution to our campaign before the deadline, and show the power of this movement?",

But first please let me explain exactly what we're using the money to do in these local district attorney races.  1) We're paying for field organizers to rally volunteers and knock on doors to spread the word about our candidates. 2) We're putting up advertisements to combat the millions of dollars in law enforcement money flowing into ads for our opponents. 3) We're sending hundreds of thousands of text messages to get our supporters the information on where, when, and how to vote. 4) We help build out websites, graphics, social media, and mailers for these local candidates who can't always afford it.  I know you feel like I do -- you want to do SOMETHING about injustice. This is your opportunity. Together we can elect district attorneys who will strike a blow to the mass incarceration system AND hold police accountable for abuse.  Right now we have a goal of 10,000 monthly donors to Real Justice to fund this incredibly important local work. I'm asking you today to dedicate just a little bit of your money each month to fueling our fight. Can we count on you?",

By diverting exponentially more cases to counseling and therapy programs, the time needed to actually solve and prosecute violent crimes, and even build out effective violence prevention programming, will be freed up.

        "Text": "Free Quebec Spice with $5 purchase because there is a special place in our heart for Canada. --   To see what Russia's leaders risked so much to gain in the 2016 election, just look at the President's attacks on the leaders of Canada, Germany and France while at the same time promoting pro-Russia forces in Britain, North Korean leadership, and now even Russia itself. The return on their election meddling has been staggering to the forces of freedom everywhere.  Right now so much is at stake. Since the 2016 election, so much of the focus has been on who the Russians worked to get elected, and what they did to make his election possible. What's been lost for the most part of the coverage of Russia's meddling has been why they took the tremendous risks they took to get this president elected.   The truth is there really is a free world that America has been the leader of for coming up on 75 years. Of course this freedom was anything but free to achieve, and was instead bought at the cost of hundreds of thousands of American lives, and millions more lives of our allies. The freedom there is in the world has been maintained through these years by America's commitment to its allies to keep Russia in check in Europe and China in check in Asia.  We travel the world for great Spices so you don't have to, and as much as we want to report back to you the tremendous goodness of the people we meet in our journeys, we also want you to understand how so much of the freedom in these people's lives only exists because the leaders of their countries believe that America is a trustworthy ally. Without the unwavering belief in American support, our allies in Europe would have long ago given in to Russia's demands just as our allies in Asia would have been forced to give in to the demands of China. We can't let that happen.  Maybe, one day, we will learn what it is the leaders of Russia have on our President, and what our President has on the Republican leaders of Congress, or we may never know. What we do know is that they are all dancing to a tune that is not an American one, at least not one we want to hear. Don't let this be Bye-bye Miss American Pie. November 6 is less than four months away. As Cooks, I'm guessing you're pretty much all registered. Now's the time to give of your time and give of your dollars. Now's the time to set the world right. Please find your way to make this November 6 once again an American election.   And while I have your attention, this is where I put in a reminder that it's a good weekend to visit one of our stores, as we do our best to remind everyone of the value of our close allies with a free with $5 purchase, regularly $6.29 Quebec Beef (and so much more) Spice. Quebec is a great blend to make the most of the rest of the Summer grilling season.

To learn more about the Quebec Spice please click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/quebec-beef-spice/c-24/p-3104/pd-s  And while you are there, even though they do not directly relate to today's events, we also have our really nice Granulated Garlic and tasty BBQ 3001 for just $2 in the 1/4-cup jars.   To see our Granulated Garlic click here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/granulated-garlic-powder/c-24/p-1000/pd-s  To see our BBQ 3001 please click here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/bbq-3001-seasoning/c-24/p-429/pd-s  No coupon or code needed for the good deal on the Granulated Garlic and BBQ 3001.

Don't place the Quebec in your basket, the code will do that for you and for free. Regular shipping and handling will apply, but those are always free with $30 spending.   And if you haven't already, please find ways to give of your time and/or your money to help make the November 6 election reflect the values of America. If you are an experienced volunteer/donor, and have good ideas for those just starting out on how to maximize your efforts, please leave them in the comments below. Or if you are good at explaining why what you do now is far more valuable than what happens in October, please leave those insights too. Cooks share wisdom, this is always a good spot to do just that.   Now is the time to make the greatest difference. Thank you for your kind heart,  Bill Penzey  bill@penzeys.com  And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category. Your shares, likes, and comments really now mean more than ever, as they help overcome the extra barriers our posts face. Thanks for your help.",

And that 60% is low-profiled, pretty much ignored between the beer and bra commercials of The Lamestream Corporate Media. Don't unsettle the buying mood!  No, it's not reassuring to advertisers when their media audiences hear broadcasts about their country's having the highest child poverty rate and lowest minimum wage among advanced Western countries ( I will recant if we're barely beating Mexico and Turkey), or about the fact that affordable healthcare and higher education in colleges and trade school are beyond the reach of the bottom 60%, as both healthcare and tuition have zoomed along, since 1981, at 4 or 5 times the rate of inflation while the minimum wage has declined by 17% in inflation-adjusted Dollars.  Meanwhile, the value of capital has increased 2300%, as the stock market has skyrocketed from a 1000 DJIA in 1981 to 24,000 this month. Worker productivity, in real terms, has risen by 51%, and the 3 Trillion Dollar 1981 GDP is now a 20 Trillion Dollar GDP, a 155% increase, even  in inflation-adjusted Dollars.  So mcuh wealth creation by a country with its nose to the grindstone, as we know that the American worker works longer hours, taking fewer vacation days, and incurring more debt to stay just to stay even, often paying 10 times the interest rate that the bank paid the Federal Reserve to obtain the money in the first place.  These are the incontrovertible facts. Tireless, productive, and maybe too patient, the average American is asking why their stake in this economy is far from equitable. Our campaign provides both answers and  practical solutions.",

None of the other people running for mayor know the county budget better than I do and absolutely none of the other candidates have a clue how to do anything but give lip service to try and get elected. Unless Hawkins county creates new revenue streams nothing the other candidates say they will do will matter because the cost of providing services will continue to go up and if all they are advocating is the same tax and spend government and fiscal responsibility nonsense they have used for the past 10 years taxes will go up or services will have to be cut. I have a solid plan to create multiple new revenue streams for Hawkins County to not only improve county services but lower county taxes and set Hawkins County up for a financially solid future that all of the county residents will benefit from. I am not trying to win a popularity contest.  I was selected as a board member of the CEDB in Washington DC because of my ability to understand a budget appropriation ramifications. I ruffled a lot of good old boys feathers in Hawkins County government  by exposing their lies about passing a budget claiming it wouldn't raise taxes then 2 months later asking for the wheel tax. I exposed the fact that the county bought a 3.5 million dollar tax derivative against the advice of the State Comptroller's office. By the way we still owe 3.1 million dollars on that derivative 6 years later because of how the interest is structured.  And they really hated it when I informed people on the 1.5 million dollar shell building that has sat empty for more than 5 years. Like I said I am not running to win a popularity contest I am going to fix the budget and eliminate the wheel tax. I will be out campaigning in multiple locations throughout the county if you see my tent on the side of the road somewhere stop and say hi.",

Today, I simply see my Mother's love. I see all that we did have due to her hard work. I see the shifts she picked up so that I could practice and play sports just like the other kids, which ultimately allowed me to go to college thanks to an athletic scholarship. Her hard work and her deep love pushed my sister and I forward allowing us to become the people we are.

House debate the issues tonight, I was struck by how utterly unable any of them were to express a single way in which he or she would veer from the national party line on any single issue, and also disappointed that no candidate mentioned the obvious and clear need to reform Congress, an issue that I've focused on from the beginning of my campaign.  None of the candidates voiced support for term limits, ending the corrupt congressional dues system, prohibiting members of Congress from fundraising while Congress is in session, the need for a balanced budget amendment, having the courage to refuse to take special interest PAC money contributions, and only one voiced support for holding states accountable for administering federal programs like GearUp and EB-5; not a single mention of any of these reforms was made.  Until we reform Congress and how it handles the people's money, very little--if anything--will be done to address the needs of ordinary South Dakotans. When elected, one of my top priorities will be to bring a reform agenda to Washington.  There will be a clear choice this fall between a candidate who favors the tried and failed status quo, and a candidate willing to fight for the change that our country and state so desperately need.\"  You can help.

'A Bronx Tale' was written by Chazz Palminteri who co-starred with Robert De Niro. About 18 months ago Chazz brought 'A Bronx Tale' to Broadway where it became an instant and constant sellout hit. Last week Chazz took over the lead role of Sonny, the gangster who actually ran Chazz's neighborhood when Chazz was a kid.  Chazz is a great friend and outstanding human being. Rosemary and I truly enjoy going to dinner with Chazz and his wife Gianna. The conversation is terrific and I am always struck by how gracious and unassuming he is to everyone who comes up to him. Chazz is a 21st century artist with strong old school values who cherishes the importance of family and friends.   Yesterday afternoon Rosemary and I went to see 'A Bronx Tale.' The play was outstanding and Chazz was superb. Afterwards Chazz invited us backstage to talk with him and meet the cast, all of whom were extremely friendly. He also introduced us to Dion Di Mucci of Dion and the Belmonts fame (named after Belmont Avenue) and we exchanged memories of another era.   Rosemary and I thanked Chazz for his friendship and we promised to get together again soon. Then, on the drive home, it was back to reality answering a string of press calls about of my criticism of the Jets and the NFL players who \"take a knee\" during the National Anthem. God Bless America!!",

When you consider the number of companion animals who are abused, neglected or euthanized each year and the way we treat farm animals, you can only conclude that we are failing to live up to our obligation.\" - P. K. Barkur  \"When there are too many human beings in a given area, we make way for them. When there are too many stray -- or wild -- animals, we kill them.\" - Diane Adams  \"People in the United States spend millions of dollars on Halloween costumes for their pets each year. I wonder how many fewer animals would be euthanized if that money were instead donated to animal shelters.\" - Mark Cuppola  \"The government allows tax deductions for 'dependents.' I think pets should be included. That would help to enable people to afford proper food and veterinary care for their pets -- including spaying and neutering -- and just might help to reduce the number of homeless animals by increasing pet ownership.\" - Jeff Kelly  Information about related issues, related news, facts, quotes, what you can do and more: http://www.animalmatters.org/",

After Stephon Clark was murdered in cold blood by Sacramento police -- shot twenty times for having a cellphone in his hand in his own backyard -- the district attorney in Sacramento refused to hold police accountable. A new investigation found that her campaign has taken a jaw-dropping $420,000 from law enforcement groups.  Facing protests from Black Lives Matter activists, the DA put up a huge fence around her office. Then blocked me personally on Twitter. Now she's deleted her entire Twitter account because she doesn't want voters in Sacramento to hold her accountable.  Real Justice is running a campaign to oust this corrupt DA and bring in a progressive candidate Noah Phillips. We need to raise a lot more money for Real Justice to win this fight, and the other important races we're engaged in. Right now we are trying to reach a goal of 10,000 monthly donors. Can you sign up for a monthly donation to help elect progressive district attorneys in Sacramento and all across the nation?",

What business would reward an employee, who received only a 2.7 out of 5 (54%) in their evaluation with the following perks:  [?] Pay raise - Increased annual salary from $185,000 to $197,000. [?] Contract extended for 2 additional years. [?] Remove the elected School Board's ability to provide full oversight and terminate the Superintendent \"without cause\". (Just like any private business can in Florida).   This is an INSULTING BAD DEAL for: [?] Hardworking teachers - who are responsible for our success.

        "Text": "THANK YOU, CCDC CHAIR BRIAN MCGINNIS, FOR YOUR ENDORSEMENT AND FAITH IN US!  Brian McGinnis writes:  Dear Democrats,  In 2017, the Chester County Democratic Committee made history. Now it's time to take our success to the next level.  We have a real opportunity to make significant gains by electing Democrats to the State Legislature and U.S. Congress, and by re-electing Governor Wolf and Senator Casey.  In order to accomplish these goals we need a steady, disciplined, experienced leader as our next Chair. DICK BINGHAM exemplifies the leadership qualities that we need in order to succeed as an organization.  He has a proven track record as a fundraiser, a team manager and builder, and as a leader in getting out the vote. We need his vision to move us forward.  Dick served as the former Chair of the Kennett Area Democrats, the largest zone in Chester County. His successful fundraising efforts improved his organization's financial stability, even allowing them to open their own campaign office every 2 years.  This, in my view, is the most crucial aspect of the job of County Chair.  As head of CCDC's Zone leader Caucus, Dick brought that ability with him in initiating a program called 'Project Seed'. He quickly raised $4,000 in 2017 to distribute to selected zones in need of \"seed\" funding.   As a result, these zones were able to start developing their own fundraising capabilities and increase communications with voters, which translated into improved candidate support at the local level.  Another key aspect of being Chairman is working collaboratively as a team. Last year I tasked Dick with developing a program to focus on key local races.   He partnered with members of the Candidate Recruitment and Development Committee to develop the 'Blue Star Program'.  He solicited recommendations from zone leaders to invest in two candidates per zone for $250 each. For the record, 32 out of 40 candidates were elected to office in 2017.  The third focus of a successful Chairman is maximizing voter turnout. Dick was able to build on this concept by filling all 22 precincts with Committee people as Chairman of the Kennett Democrats.  He was able to recruit quality candidates as well. This led to the successful Democratic takeover of Kennett Township and Kennett Borough.  He also was able to elect numerous Democrats to school board during his term as Chair.  Dick Bingham possesses both the personal qualities and the management skills we need to lead our party to the next level, in a year when we have a great opportunity to win big.  I am proud to support the team of Dick Bingham, Marsha Peltz, Maryann Piccioni, and David Rhoads for leadership of the Chester County Democratic Committee.  Let's all move forward together and make history again!  Sincerely,  Brian J McGinnis, Chair Chester County Democratic Committee  484 459 5330  #TurnChesterCountyBlue #FreedomFairnessOpportunity #BeTheWave",
