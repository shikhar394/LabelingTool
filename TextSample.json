The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) announced the passage of an important milestone in its Assumption Reinsurance Depopulation Program (Assumption program): agents have approved 18,000 policies for possible transfer from TWIA to participating private market insurers. What is depopulation? Depopulation is a series of programs authorized by 2015 state law and designed to provide TWIA policyholders with alternative options for wind and hail insurance in the private market. The programs function in the following way: TWIA provides policy data to participating insurers who then make offers to assume, or transfer, TWIA policies.  Or consumers can opt for the \"All Perils\" Home Policy, Homeowners and Windstorm coverage in one policy through select Independent Insurance Agents Appointed direct with each company. Can all Insurance Agents help with depopulation? No, most Captive Insurance Agents are apart of TWIA Depopulation Windstorm and Hail ONLY program...only select Independent Insurance Agents Appointed direct with each company can offer the \"All Perils\" Windstorm Included Homeowners Coverage that provides the most savings for dwellings and consumers that qualify. What area of Gulf Coast is included in TWIA Depopulation? All Dwelling 1,000 feet from Gulf Of Mexico are eligible for private Windstorm and Hail, providing 10% to 15% Savings. All dwellings 1+ miles from coast are eligible for \"All Perils\" windstorm included Homeowner's Policy, potential savings up to 35%.",

        "Text": "I keep getting requests for me to post the story of how I met my wife on my Facebook page.  It is a pretty amazing story...it's like something you would expect to see in a movie. This post has absolutely nothing to do with politics, but for those of you who want to hear the story, here goes:  On May 25th, 2016 I stepped onto a tour bus in Rome, Italy. As I climbed up the stairs I looked up and saw an absolutely gorgeous girl sitting there looking down at me. I thought to myself, \"This trip just got a whole lot more interesting!\" and I sat in the seat in front of her. We talked for almost 4 hours on the bus that day and I was immediately hooked.   We toured all over Italy and I spent the majority of my time talking to Hannah. Five days into the tour we went to Pisa to see the Leaning Tower. It was pouring rain! I bought an umbrella from a street vendor and offered to share it with Hannah. The tour guide at Pisa asked if we were a couple and I joked that we were engaged before admitting that I had just met her a few days earlier. The tour guide embarrassed us in front of the whole group by saying that we obviously went together well and that we should become a couple. Little did I know that his comments prompted Hannah to consider a relationship with me.  I quickly figured out I had found the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.  I also knew I only had 17 days to make her fall in love with me. One morning I asked to sit by her on the bus and virtually from that moment on we were always together.   We then travelled to Paris. We split off from the rest of the group and found some space by ourselves on top of the Eiffel Tower, and it was there I told her how beautiful she was for the first time. I asked a tourist to take some photos of us and I secretly bought an Eiffel Tower picture frame, put that picture in it, and gave it to her when we parted ways at the airport a few days later.  Once in London I took the subway until I found a flower shop. I bought her some long-stemmed roses and wrote her a note asking for her phone number. I left those items outside of her hotel room door a few minutes before she was heading down to supper. As you probably already guessed...I got the phone number!  Over the course of one year, I made 35 weekend trips to South Carolina to spend time with Hannah.  She was able to visit Alabama 5 times during that year as well, and she quickly fell in love with the area and the people who live here. On October 29th, 2016, I rented an airplane in Greenville, SC and flew Hannah back to Alabama.  I had secretly bought a ring and scheduled a photographer to be at the TVA Rockpile to capture the moment.  There, in front of the waterfall, I asked Hannah to be my wife.  Hannah finished out her teaching contract at Hidden Treasure Christian School in May 2017. We were married on June 30th, 2017 at her home church in Greenville, SC.  For our honeymoon, we returned to Venice, Italy and then cruised the Baltic Sea.",

This means that too many churches are not ready to serve those considering abortion in their pews.   James 1:27 compels us to care for orphans and widows. Accordingly, God created His church to fight to protect the unborn and build strong families. In this fight, love is our weapon and the gospel our first priority.  The high numbers of Christians having abortions are a challenge and an opportunity for your church to become more actively involved. Your role is essential in saving the unborn from abortion, and connecting lost women and men facing unplanned and/or unwanted pregnancies with the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Learn how you can help your church become a place of compassion, hope, and help for those considering abortion - to make your church \"abortion ready\" with our simple six step process.

And that 60% is low-profiled, pretty much ignored between the beer and bra commercials of The Lamestream Corporate Media. Don't unsettle the buying mood!  No, it's not reassuring to advertisers when their media audiences hear broadcasts about their country's having the highest child poverty rate and lowest minimum wage among advanced Western countries ( I will recant if we're barely beating Mexico and Turkey), or about the fact that affordable healthcare and higher education in colleges and trade school are beyond the reach of the bottom 60%, as both healthcare and tuition have zoomed along, since 1981, at 4 or 5 times the rate of inflation while the minimum wage has declined by 17% in inflation-adjusted Dollars.  Meanwhile, the value of capital has increased 2300%, as the stock market has skyrocketed from a 1000 DJIA in 1981 to 24,000 this month. Worker productivity, in real terms, has risen by 51%, and the 3 Trillion Dollar 1981 GDP is now a 20 Trillion Dollar GDP, a 155% increase, even  in inflation-adjusted Dollars.  So mcuh wealth creation by a country with its nose to the grindstone, as we know that the American worker works longer hours, taking fewer vacation days, and incurring more debt to stay just to stay even, often paying 10 times the interest rate that the bank paid the Federal Reserve to obtain the money in the first place.  These are the incontrovertible facts. Tireless, productive, and maybe too patient, the average American is asking why their stake in this economy is far from equitable. Our campaign provides both answers and  practical solutions.",

[?]Now, we are searching for motivated individuals/couples who are interested in joining our team and living life to the fullest!    First, a little about us..   Jordy: I have bounced around jobs since graduating from college in May 2013. I was a ski lift operator in the Rocky Mountains the winter after college then I came back home the following spring to start a summer job as a railroad laborer. I ended up proving myself as hardworking and reliable and was offered a full time position as a train conductor. After a about a year the railroad started to slow down and I started getting laid off in the winter. After several winters laid off I decided this wasn't going to work for me. I had goals to achieve and at 27 years old I was just getting by....I wanted to do more than get by......way more.    Michelle: I'm a nurse. Ultimately I was not making enough at my job to fund my dreams of seeing the world so I picked up a local travel job on top of my full time job (that job was 2.5 hours away). Everyone always asked me \"Is the money worth it?\". And, in short, my answer was no. I was exhausted. I didn't see my family or friends for two months and only saw my boyfriend in passing. I was not taking care of myself mentally or physically; I was well on my way to being burnt out in my fourth year of nursing. It was then, when I was working 72+ hours a week-not including driving time, that I realized there had to be a better way.   We wanted more time to travel, to see family/friends, to pursue our passions. And we both recognized that health is not guaranteed.  WE WANTED TO TRULY LIVE.   Then, we came across an opportunity that taught us step-by-step how to run a business from our laptops/cellphones. We're connected to a platform that is 90% automated. Meaning a nurse/train conductor-with no background in business or sales, is able to learn to do this.    The thoughts/concerns that come up: \"This must be a scam.\", \"This can't be real.\", \"It can't be that easy\"..   Yeah, those thoughts are familiar.  We were lucky enough that the person who introduced us to the opportunity went to the same college Michelle did, but we were still a little skeptical at first. So, we asked all the questions we had and ultimately, we discovered it was a perfect fit for us and what we want out of life.  And now, since we're connected to an online platform that works 24/7 from anywhere in the world.. We earn money while doing all of the things we enjoy..like jumping off a catamaran into the Sea of Cortez, or hanging out in the D.R, or even while we sleep!  But maybe it's just never missing a child's soccer game or recital. Maybe it's never working the holidays again. Maybe it's traveling the world. Whatever the goal, it's possible. It's all up to you.  We teamed up to run the business and our goal is to help as many people as we can escape the 9-5 paycheck to paycheck lifestyle. Today, the digital world is thriving and that is how we have been able to help others achieve their goals.   Now, instead of sleeping/working all the time, we're brushing up on our Italian for our trip to Rome/Naples this fall .

Simple workarounds allow corporations to own and convert unlimited houses into short-term vacation rentals.  Doors open at 10.  Attend and make your voice heard before it is too late!  Tell Councilmembers they must protect us, our friends, our homes and our neighborhoods instead of selling us out to Airbnb if they want our votes.

        "Text": "Where do you live in Rib Mountain? If it is on one of 61 particular roads, whether the answer to that question will remain the same is still up in the air. Yesterday, the County petitioned the Wisconsin Supreme Court to review the decision of the Court of Appeals, which had reversed the circuit court in the Town's favor on whether the names of those 61 roads will have to change as part of the County's effort to implement a uniform addressing system.   So what did the Legislature do about it? Nothing. Should it have? Perhaps, since the one thing more than nothing is likely the legal bills. As a practicing lawyer myself, I have argued in the Court of Appeals and petitioned the Supreme Court for review. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. In this particular case, it boils down to one simple word in the statute - \"rural,\" and the question before the court is whether the county's statutory authority to implement a uniform addressing system extends beyond \"rural\" roads.   No one knows because the Legislature never defined the word. So define it. The issue has been weaving through the courts for well over a year and both sides deserve clarity. Getting it through the Legislature should not have been an issue because almost all counties in the state have gone through the process and could care less to go back, so it won't impact them. So why has it not been addressed - no pun intended? Easier to navigate the shoals that way. Just call it a local shooting match and move on.   Well, that is just not how I operate. Certain groups in Mosinee are likely happy to tell you I have upset them because something needs to be addressed and people elect you to take positions. If more than half disagree next time around, you're done and the next person is up. That is how I plan to represent the 86th starting in January.   My position on uniform addressing is this - some will agree; some will disagree; hence, my comments above. I would have talked to the County, then I would have talked to the Town, and I would have said to both I am going to put something on the table to define \"rural\" in hopes of saving everyone a lot of time, effort and legal expense. You folks give me some input, whether that is the US Census data, the Metropolitan Planning Organization documents or some other metric, and let's move forward.   Maybe it would have died in committee; maybe it would have been an easy rider to bill and saved everyone some time. Too late now. By the time of the next legislative session briefing in the Supreme Court will likely be done or wrapping up if it takes the case and the legal expense is done.   In the future, anytime there is an opening to save local governments in my district a headache, I plan to help while turning as much of the input over to them as possible. Vote August 14th. Thank you.",

The other seeks to 'promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering education excellence and ensuring equal access.'

        "Text": "The secret of freedom lies in educating people, whereas the secret of tyranny is in keeping them ignorant. Maximilien Robespierre.  Mayor Troy Walker just announced at the July 17th City Council meeting that he was going to crack down on citizens' rights and keep them ignorant of what he is doing behind the closed doors at city hall!  The mayor has decided that the citizens should no longer be allowed to interact with the city attorney.  He believes that the attorney is his personal attorney and only represents his interests and those of the city council and that the public has no right to ask the City Attorney a legal question or any question. He even stated that the information provided by the attorney to the citizens might come back to haunt the city council and/or the City.  The Mayor claimed that the city attorney should not be allowed to explain the code or explain the city's position to a citizen because it could be detrimental to the city council and his interests. Wow, what is the mayor so afraid of?  Why would explaining the code to a citizen put the mayor and council in legal jeopardy?  The only reason they would be in legal jeopardy is if they were violating the city codes and laws!    Mr. Mayor, who do you think pays the City Attorney's $200,000 salary?  Do you and the council pay for the attorney out of your pockets?  No, you don't.  The citizens of Draper pay the City Attorney's salary, we also pay the mayor's inflated salary.  If a citizen has a question once in a while about how the city interprets a code or needs to alert the city of actions that violate the code, they should be encouraged to do so. The citizens have tried to do it with you and it just falls on deaf ears.   According to the Mayor, what sparked his attention on this was the whole Moda project.  Moda has been a pet project of the mayor's that the citizens have fought vigorously to defeat.  Moda is still being battled by the citizens to this day and the mayor cannot stand it.  The leader of the Moda Citizens group, Kelle Land, has been fighting for the citizens on this cause since February 2018. The reason she had to contact the City Attorney was to inform him that the city council was provided inaccurate and incomplete information by the Moda Town Center developer. The planning commission and the city council have approved the site plan and preliminary plat using this incorrect information.  Mrs. Land has actually been trying to help the city protect itself and all the citizens from these errors. In fact, the city has a code that makes it illegal for a developer to provide inaccurate and incomplete information and Mrs. Land has been doing her best to try to get the city to follow their own code and void the preliminary plat before the mayor signs the final plat. This is why the mayor has gone into a police state mode!  The one thing the mayor hates most is transparency and knowledgeable citizens. He cannot stand the scrutiny and accountability that has suddenly been thrust upon him and his \"Good Ole Boys\" by this page and other citizens.  The mayor is now putting the city into a bunker mentality mode!  He is going to do everything he can to shut down all information coming out of city hall.  He is taking our rights as Americans and shredding them for his political benefit.  He knows he can do this because his past experience tells him that the citizens are too busy to care. He knows that he has the backing of the \"Good Ole Boy Network\" and the financial security of the developers behind him.  It is a perfect storm for him to grab total power and subjugate the citizens of Draper.   Point of the Mountain will not sit quietly by while the mayor attempts his coup at city hall.  The mayor has asked for a resolution or ordinance to be brought back to the city council that would prohibit the city attorney from responding to citizens.  We need to make this attempt by the mayor so politically painful that the council will not support this ordinance!  We must inundate the council with emails opposing this attempt to limit information.  We must also show up at the council meeting and demand they vote no on any such ordinance.  Point of the Mountain Politics will keep you informed of when this ordinance will be in front of the council for a vote.  It would be helpful if you start sending emails now telling the council to stop this ordinance or resolution from even being drafted and to protect your right to receive information from city hall!  Send your emails now and let the city council know that you want them to vote no on the mayors attempt to shut down communication and information flow to Draper City Hall to the citizens.  We have attached the emails for the council members and the mayor for your convenience. Please take a few seconds and send the email.  troy.walker@draper.ut.us  mike.green@draper.ut.us   michele.weeks@draper.ut.us  marsha.vawdrey@draper.ut.us  alan@guadalahonkys.com  tasha.lowery@draper.ut.us",

In order to coincide with World Suicide Prevention Day, this will be observed every year on September 10th.   I was recently inspired to take personal action on this, after my good friend Theron Wilson lost his brother. My hope is that this will help continue to bring attention to the mental health crisis in this country, especially the vast number of veterans being affected. In addition I hope that it will assist Theron, and his family in their efforts to raise funds to save others before it is too late.   You never know what other people are going through, be kind.

We must support the update of asylum criteria to prioritize LGBTQ+ people whose lives or basic civil rights are under threat because they come from countries that persecute people for their sexual orientation. We need comprehensive immigration reform that protects all LGBTQ+.  As California Lt. Governor, I will always stand on the side of our LGBTQ+ community in confronting bullying, discrimination or hate crimes - whether it's in our schools, our workplaces or our senior care facilities.  I will push to fully implement the California State Board of Education's decision to include in the curriculum the contributions of lesbian, gay, bisxual and transgender Americans.  This month, and every month, stand united with me in asserting: We are all Gay Pride. There is no going back, only forward, and there is no compromise when it comes to protecting the rights and freedoms of our neighbors.  #PrideMonth",
